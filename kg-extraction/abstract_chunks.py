""" 39903824: OBJECTIVES: Sepiapterin reductase deficiency (SRD) is a rare dopa-sensitive neurotransmitter disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the sepiapterin reductase gene. The triad of paroxysmal stiffening, oculogyric crises, and hypotonia are highly suggestive in some patients. However, in other patients, the clinical picture may be nonspecific and remain under-recognized and misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39903824/ """,
""" 39903824: CASE PRESENTATION: We present a nine-month-old boy who initially presented with hypotonia and developmental delay, diagnosed as vitamin B12 deficiency. Upon he did not respond to vitamin replacement treatment, he was diagnosed with SRD by whole-exome sequencing (WES). The boy improved dramatically under treatment with L-dopa, 5-hydroxytryptophan and BH4. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39903824/ """,
""" 39903824: CONCLUSIONS: We aim to emphasize that SRD can present with nonspecific symptoms, leading to a diagnostic delay for this rare but treatable disease. Moreover, our case is the first to demonstrate the clinical benefit of BH4 add-on treatment. Early intervention is crucial for good outcome and neurodevelopment. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39903824/ """,

""" 39914079: Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element for biological growth and development. Excessive intake of Cu exists harmful effects on organisms. However, whether excessive Cu intake induces kidney function damage by gut microbiota regulation remains unclear. Ducks are important species of waterfowl that are often exposed to Cu contamination in water sources. In this study, we aim to elucidate the effects of Cu exposure on renal inflammation through the gut-kidney axis in ducks. The ducks were gavaged with different doses of CuSO<sub>4</sub> (0, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight) for 4 weeks. Results indicate that Cu exposure causes pathological damage to the kidney, with a significant increase in the levels of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β in both serum and renal tissue. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that the relative abundances of Candidatus_Saccharimonas and Bacteroides were significantly reduced in the Cu-induced group. Transcriptomic analysis of kidney tissue reveals that following Cu exposure, 30 genes show significant differential expression. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were most involved in Interleukin-1 Receptor Activity, Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, Nitrogen metabolism, and Proximal tubule bicarbonate reclamation. Metabolomic analysis revealed that 28 metabolites are present in both kidney tissue and cecal contents. Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation among 5 common metabolites: Aminoglutethimide, Boscalid, Dantrolene, Cer[ns] d34:1, and Stearidonic acid. In the cecum, these five metabolites are closely associated with 26 intestinal microorganisms, including Bacteroides, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, and Colidextribacter. In the kidney, apart from Stearidonic acid, the other four metabolites are closely correlated with genes such as FOS, and IL1RL1. Overall, our study indicates that excessive Cu induces significant kidney inflammation, the metabolites alteration and gut microbiota disorders. These findings shed light on the underlying mechanisms of Cu-induced kidney damage via the indirect pathway of the gut-kidney axis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39914079/ """,
""" 39885115: Inhibition of the target of rapamycin (TOR/mTOR) protein kinase by the drug rapamycin extends lifespan and health span across diverse species. However, rapamycin has potential off-target and side effects that warrant the discovery of additional TOR inhibitors. TOR was initially discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) which contains two TOR paralogs, TOR1 and TOR2. Yeast lacking functional Tor1 are viable but are hypersensitive to growth inhibition by TORC1 inhibitors, which is a property of yeast that can be exploited to identify TOR inhibitors. Additionally, yeast lacking FK506-sensitive proline rotamase (FPR1) or containing a tor1-1 allele (a mutation in the Fpr1-rapamycin binding domain of Tor1) are robustly and selectively resistant to rapamycin and analogs that allosterically inhibit TOR activity via an FPR1-dependent mechanism. To facilitate the identification of TOR inhibitors, we generated a panel of yeast strains with mutations in TOR pathway genes combined with the removal of 12 additional genes involved in drug efflux. This creates a drug-sensitive strain background that can sensitively and effectively identify TOR inhibitors. In a wild-type yeast strain background, 25 µM of Torin1 and 100 µM of GSK2126458 (omipalisib) are necessary to observe TOR1-dependent growth inhibition by these known TOR inhibitors. In contrast, 100 nM Torin1 and 500 nM GSK2126458 (omipalisib) are sufficient to identify TOR1-dependent growth inhibition in the drug-sensitized background. This represents a 200-fold and 250-fold increase in detection sensitivity for Torin1 and GSK2126458, respectively. Additionally, for the TOR inhibitor AZD8055, the drug-sensitive system resolves that the compound results in TOR1-dependent growth sensitivity at 100 µM, whereas no growth inhibition is observed in a wild-type yeast strain background. Our platform also identifies the caffeine analog aminophylline as a TOR1-dependent growth inhibitor via selective tor1 growth sensitivity. We also tested nebivolol, isoliquiritigenin, canagliflozin, withaferin A, ganoderic acid A, and taurine and found no evidence for TOR inhibition using our yeast growth-based model. Our results demonstrate that this system is highly effective at identifying compounds that inhibit the TOR pathway. It offers a rapid, cost-efficient, and sensitive tool for drug discovery, with the potential to expedite the identification of new TOR inhibitors that could serve as geroprotective and/or anti-cancer agents. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39885115/ """,
""" 39744441: Endometrial cancer, a common gynecological malignancy, poses significant clinical challenges, particularly in advanced or recurrent cases. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a serine/threonine kinase, plays crucial roles in inflammation and immunity by activating nuclear factor (NF)-κB and interferon regulatory factor 3. However, its specific roles in endometrial cancer remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-cancer effects and underlying mechanisms of amlexanox, a TBK1 inhibitor, against endometrial cancer. The main genetic mutations in TBK1 were found to be mRNA downregulation and missense mutations. Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis revealed that low TBK1 expression was associated with a good prognosis in patients with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). In vitro experiments demonstrated that TBK1 knockdown or amlexanox significantly inhibited the proliferation, cell cycle progression, and migration of endometrial cancer cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of targeting TBK1 on cancer cell proliferation and migration were mediated by the protein kinase B (AKT)/NF-κB signaling pathway. Xenograft experiments revealed that both amlexanox treatment and TBK1 knockdown effectively suppressed the tumor growth. Overall, this study highlights the potent anti-cancer effects of amlexanox against endometrial cancer by modulating AKT/NF-κB signaling, thus providing a new avenue for the development of novel TBK1-targeting therapeutic strategies for UCEC. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39744441/ """,
""" 39949584: Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common gynecological concern often attributed to hormonal disorders, malignancies, or infections. While bacterial and viral infections are frequently investigated, fungal infections, such as aspergillosis, are often overlooked. This case report highlights a rare instance of endometrial aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus quadrilineatus in an immunocompetent woman. A 64-year-old woman presented with persistent vaginal bleeding. Histopathological examination of endometrial tissue revealed septate hyphae consistent with fungal infection. Molecular analysis identified the causative agent as A. quadrilineatus. The A. quadrilineatus isolate demonstrated susceptibility to various antifungal agents, including azoles and amphotericin B. This report emphasizes the need for increased awareness of fungal infections, including aspergillosis, as a potential cause of AUB. Further research is needed to enhance understanding of the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical manifestations of endometrial aspergillosis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39949584/ """,
""" 39937019: Mucociliary clearance, the ability of the respiratory tract to protect the integrity of the airways through the mechanical removal of potentially harmful substances, is of enormous importance during intensive care treatment. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of clinically relevant inotropic agents on mucociliary clearance. The particle transport velocity (PTV) of isolated murine tracheae was measured as a surrogate for mucociliary clearance in the presence of dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone. Inhibitory substances were applied to elucidate the signal transduction cascades and the value and origin of calcium ions which provoke alterations in mucociliary clearance function. Dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone increased the PTV in a dose-dependent manner with half maximal effective concentrations of 75.7 nM, 87.0 nM, and 13.7 µM, respectively. After the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, no increase in PTV was observed after administering any of the three inotropic agents. While dobutamine and epinephrine activated β-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine used both the phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathway to promote the release of intracellular Ca2+. However, dobutamine primarily acted on the PKA pathway, having only a minor influence on the PLC pathway. The induced changes in PTV following milrinone administration required both the PKA and PLC pathway, although the PKA pathway was responsible for most of the induced changes. In conclusion, the common inotropic agents dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone increase murine PTV in a concentration-dependent manner and ultimately release Ca2+ from intracellular calcium stores, suggesting the function of changes in mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937019/ """,
""" 38649359: DltB, a model member of the Membrane-Bound O-AcylTransferase (MBOAT) superfamily, plays a crucial role in D-alanylation of the lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a significant component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. This process stabilizes the cell wall structure, influences bacterial virulence, and modulates the host immune response. Despite its significance, the role of DltB is not well understood. Through biochemical analysis and cryo-EM imaging, we discover that Streptococcus thermophilus DltB forms a homo-tetramer on the cell membrane. We further visualize DltB in an apo form, in complex with DltC, and in complex with its inhibitor amsacrine (m-AMSA). Each tetramer features a central hole. The C-tunnel of each protomer faces the intratetramer interface and provides access to the periphery membrane. Each protomer binds a DltC without changing the tetrameric organization. A phosphatidylglycerol (PG) molecule in the substrate-binding site may serve as an LTA carrier. The inhibitor m-AMSA bound to the L-tunnel of each protomer blocks the active site. The tetrameric organization of DltB provides a scaffold for catalyzing D-alanyl transfer and regulating the channel opening and closing. Our findings unveil DltB's dual function in the D-alanylation pathway, and provide insight for targeting DltB as a anti-virulence antibiotic. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38649359/ """,
""" 39948886: The patient was a 38-year-old premenopausal woman. Under the diagnosis of left breast cancer with cT2N3cM1(OSS), Stage Ⅳ, Luminal B like, we started treatment with anastrozole, leuprorelin, abemaciclib and denosumab. Two months after starting treatment, headache and nausea were observed. A contrast-enhanced MR scan of the head showed 2 brain metastases measuring 3 mm in the right frontal lobe and 7 mm in the left frontal cortex. Radiotherapy and surgical resection were considered for the brain metastases. However, due to the possibility of neurological complications and the short time since abemaciclib was administered, the patient was continued on the same treatment until the efficacy of the treatment was determined. Three months after restarting treatment, an MRI of the head showed that the brain metastases had disappeared. The primary tumor had shrunk and some of the lymph nodes were obscured. Fifteen months has passed since the brain metastases disappeared, but no new lesions have been observed and the patient continues to receive abemaciclib therapy. Abemaciclib has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. It also has a longer intracerebral retention time than other CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combination therapy with abemaciclib may be a useful treatment option for HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with brain metastases. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39948886/ """,
""" 39940043: BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles derived from pericytes (PCEVs) have been shown to improve vascular permeability, with their therapeutic effects attributed to the presence of pro-regenerative molecules. We hypothesized that angiopoietin 1 (Angpt1) carried by PCEVs contributes to their therapeutic effects after sepsis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39940043/ """,
""" 39940043: METHODS: A cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis rat model was used in vivo, and the effects of PCEVs on vascular endothelial cells were studied in vitro. First, proteomic and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses were performed to analyze the therapeutic mechanism of PCEVs, revealing that the angiogenesis-related protein Angpt1 was highly expressed in PCEVs. We then down-regulated Angpt1 in PCEVs. The role of PCEV-carried Angpt1 on intestinal barrier function, PCs recruitment, and inflammatory cytokines was measured by using septic Sprague-Dawley rats and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-β)-Cre + mT/mG transgenic mice. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39940043/ """,
""" 39940043: RESULTS: PCEVs significantly improved vascular permeability, proliferation, and angiogenesis in CLP-induced gut barrier injury both in vivo and in vitro. Further studies have shown that PCEVs exert a protective effect on intestinal barrier function and PC recruitment. Additionally, PCEVs reduced serum inflammatory factor levels. Our data also demonstrated that the protein levels of phospho-PI3K and phospho-Akt both increased after PCEVs administration, whereas knocking out Angpt1 suppressed the protective effects of PCEVs through decreased activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39940043/ """,

""" 39955841: Territorial competition can stimulate secretion of testosterone (T), which is thought to act on neural circuits of aggression to promote further aggression. Here, we test the hypothesis that competition modulates sex steroid sensitivity and conversion in the brain, focused on the female tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor). In this bird species, exogenous T enhances female aggression, but social competition for limited nesting territories does not stimulate systemic T elevation. We exposed free-living females to simulated territorial intrusions and sampled five regions of the vertebrate social behavior network (SBN). Using quantitative PCR, we measured mRNA abundance of: androgen receptor, 5-alpha reductase, estrogen receptor alpha, and aromatase. Using standard analyses, we found essentially no treatment effect on mRNA abundance in any one brain area; however, network analyses revealed marked socially-induced changes in gene co-expression across the SBN. After a territorial challenge, gene expression was more positively correlated with T, and genes specific to the androgen-signaling pathway were also more positively correlated with one another. The challenged brain also exhibited stronger negative correlations among genes in the nucleus taeniae, but stronger positive correlations between the lateral septum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Together, these findings suggest that, in response to female-female territorial challenges, T acts on androgen-mediated circuits of aggression, with some divergence in gene regulation in the nucleus taeniae. The post-transcriptional consequences of these shifts require more research, but their existence underscores insights to be gained from analyzing the neuroendocrine properties of the SBN using network-level perspectives. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955841/ """,
""" 39367970: Arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) catalyzes the hydrolysis of small molecules containing ester and amide bonds. Recently, it has been reported that AADAC can suppress reactive oxygen species production in cancer cells. This study aimed to elucidate the possibility that AADAC protects against drug-induced liver injury accompanied by oxidative stress and to explore its molecular mechanisms. Intraperitoneal administration of carbon tetrachloride induced significantly more severe liver injury in Aadac knockout (KO) mice (plasma alanine aminotransferase level: 19,381 ± 10,578 U/L) than in wild-type (WT) mice (7219 ± 4729 U/L). More severe liver injury in Aadac KO mice was accompanied by higher hepatic malondialdehyde and antioxidant gene mRNA levels than those in WT mice. The increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase levels in Aadac KO mice was substantially suppressed by pretreatment with the ferroptosis inhibitors deferoxamine or ferrostatin-1, suggesting that Aadac deficiency increases susceptibility to ferroptosis. Immunoprecipitation followed by proteomic analysis revealed that AADAC interacts with ceruloplasmin (CP), which oxidizes ferrous iron to ferric iron. Hepatic CP activity was significantly lower in Aadac KO mice than that in WT mice, resulting in elevated hepatic ferrous iron levels in Aadac KO mice. Overexpression of human AADAC in Huh-7 cells significantly attenuated carbon tetrachloride-induced cytotoxicity by suppressing ferrous iron accumulation, suggesting that AADAC interacts with CP to suppress hepatic ferrous iron accumulation. The hepatoprotective role of Aadac in ferroptosis was also observed in mice with acetaminophen-induced liver injury. This study demonstrates a novel function of AADAC in protecting against ferroptosis induced by hepatotoxicants, carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39367970/ """,

At the same time, while breastfeeding, AFB<sub>1</sub> crosses the mammary glands and enters the milk, harming the offspring. This study investigated the liver damaging effects of maternal AFB<sub>1</sub> exposure during pregnancy and lactation in offspring mice. The livers of 8-day-old offspring mice were obtained from female mice who were administered AFB<sub>1</sub> (2 mg/kg) 1 week prior to and 1 week following birth. The results showed that AFB<sub>1</sub> increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), pro-inflammatory-related proteins (iNOS, COX-2, IL-6), and apoptosis-related proteins (Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Bax) by AFB<sub>1</sub>-induced in liver of offspring mice. Furthermore, the use of F40/80, HE, and TUNEL staining further demonstrated the existence of inflammation and apoptosis in the liver. Intriguingly, in the liver of offspring mice, AFB<sub>1</sub> increased antioxidant protein and inhibit ferroptosis-related protein activity (FTH, GPX4), mitochondrial function-associated proteins (UQCRC2, COX IV, Cyt C), lipid metabolism-associated proteins (HMGCR, SPEBE1, FAS), and autophagy-related proteins (Atg7, Beclin-1, LC3I/II) in the liver of mice. In conclusion, AFB<sub>1</sub> enters the liver of offspring mice through milk, which in turn causes liver injury.

""" 39300654: Aspartate/asparagine-β-hydroxylase (AspH) is a transmembrane 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the post-translational hydroxylation of aspartate- and asparagine-residues in epidermal growth factor-like domains (EGFDs) of its substrate proteins. Upregulation of ASPH and translocation of AspH from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to the surface membrane of cancer cells is associated with enhanced cell motility and worsened clinical prognosis. AspH is thus a potential therapeutic and diagnostic target for cancer. This chapter describes methods for the production and purification of soluble constructs of recombinant human AspH suitable for biochemical and crystallographic studies. The chapter also describes efficient methods for performing turnover and inhibition assays which monitor catalysis of isolated recombinant human AspH in vitro using solid phase extraction coupled to mass spectrometry (SPE-MS). The SPE-MS assays employ synthetic disulfide- or thioether-bridged macrocyclic oligopeptides as substrates; a macrocycle is an apparently essential requirement for productive AspH catalysis and mimics an EGFD disulfide isomer that is not typically observed in crystal and NMR structures. SPE-MS assays can be used to monitor catalysis of 2OG oxygenases other than AspH; the methods described herein are representative for 2OG oxygenase SPE-MS assays useful for performing kinetic and/or inhibition studies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39300654/ """,

This study aims to evaluate the potential of the FDA-disapproved antihistamine astemizole as an antibacterial agent, with a focus on its efficacy against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Astemizole demonstrated significant activity against Gram-positive bacteria, especially MRSA, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 4 to 16 μg/mL and 4-32 μg/mL, respectively. However, astemizole showed minimal activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Further investigations revealed that astemizole killed bacteria by disrupting the bacterial membrane, altering membrane potential, inhibiting ATP production, and inducing reactive oxygen species accumulation. Additionally, The resistance mutation frequency of astemizole was low, with only a minor increase in resistance observed in MRSA after 30 days of selective pressure, significantly less than that of ampicillin. Cytotoxicity and hemolysis assays indicated that astemizole was relatively safe at concentrations effective for bacterial inhibition. The Galleria mellonella infection model further confirmed the efficacy of astemizole against MRSA in vivo. Overall, this study provides new insights into the repurposing of astemizole and suggests its potential as a therapeutic agent to address antibiotic resistance. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39929397/ """,

""" 39882695: In general, ghrelin is known as one of the orexigenic hormones in mammals. On the other hand, it has been shown that ghrelin inhibits water intake, which appear to be inconsistent with its role in the feeding response. In this study, the effect of ghrelin on water intake was comprehensively addressed using conscious seawater-acclimated eels known as an experimental model for water drinking behaviour. When injected intra-arterially, ghrelin inhibited copious drinking in a dose-dependent manner without affecting arterial pressure. This effect contrasted with the inhibitory effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on drinking, which is synchronized with a vasodepressor effect. Similarly, intra-cerebroventricular injection of ghrelin also decreased the drinking rate without affecting arterial pressure. Continuous infusion of ghrelin from the ventral aorta also decreased the drinking rate, concomitant with an increase in plasma ghrelin concentration. The inhibitory effects of ghrelin on drinking were as potent and efficacious as those of ANP. The inhibitory action was not blocked by pre-treatment with a ghrelin receptor antagonist ([D-Lys3] GHRP-6); consistently, the agonist form (GHRP-6) injected intra-arterially did not show any inhibitory effect of ghrelin when injected peripherally. These studies demonstrated that ghrelin is a potent anti-dipsogen in eels without baroreflex and ANP secretion, and it is possible that ghrelin's effect might be mediated through another type of ghrelin receptor that [D-Lys3] GHRP-6 or GHRP-6 do not bind. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882695/ """,

""" 39940954: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is recognized as the third most lethal cancer worldwide. While existing treatment options demonstrate considerable efficacy, they are often constrained by non-selectivity and substantial side effects. Recent studies indicate that lipid metabolism significantly influences carcinogenesis, highlighting it as a promising avenue for developing targeted anticancer therapies. The purpose of the study was to see if acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase (SCD1) are good metabolic targets and whether the use of inhibitors of these enzymes together with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) would have a synergistic effect on CRC cell viability. To confirm that the correct lipid targets were chosen, the expression levels of ACAT1, HMGCR, and SCD1 were examined in CRC patients and cell models. At first, each compound (Avasimibe, Lovastatin, MF-438, and 5-FU was tested separately, and then each inhibitor was paired with 5-FU to assess the synergistic effect on cell viability. Gene expression of selected enzymes significantly increased in tissue samples obtained from CRC patients and cancer cell lines (HT-29). Inhibition of any of the selected enzymes reduced CRC cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, the combination of 5-FU + Avasimibe (an ACAT1 inhibitor) and 5-FU + MF-438 (an SCD1 inhibitor) produced a stronger antiproliferative effect than the inhibitors alone. 5-FU combined either with Avasimibe or MF-438 showed a synergistic effect with an HSA score of 47.00 at a dose of 0.3 + 30 µM, respectively (2.66% viability rate vs. 46%; p &lt; 0.001), and 39.34 at a dose of 0.3 + 0.06 µM (46% vs. 10.33%; p &lt; 0.001), respectively. The association of 5-FU with Lovastatin (HMGCR inhibitor) did not significantly impact CRC cell viability in a synergistic manner. Inhibition of lipid metabolism combined with standard chemotherapy is a promising strategy that reduces CRC cell viability and allows for the use of a lower drug dose.

Shotgun MS data of vehicle and liraglutide-treated mouse groups are separated in the supervised multivariate analysis and separation is also achieved in the subsequent unsupervised multivariate analysis using targeted MS data. The mouse group receiving the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide has increased protein abundances of glutathione peroxidase-3 (GPX3) and catalase (CATA) while the abundances of neuroplastin (NPTN) and bifunctional glutamate/proline-tRNA ligase (SYEP) are decreased compared to the STZ vehicle mice. The data suggest that GLP-1R agonism mainly influences abundances of structurally involved proteins and proteins involved in oxidative stress responses in the STZ mouse kidney. The changes could be direct effects of GLP-1R agonism in the kidneys or indirectly caused by a systemic response to GLP-1R activation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30806030/ """,
""" 39955662: Cryopreservation is a long-term storage strategy for maintaining the quality of red blood cells (RBCs) used for clinical and industrial purposes. However, cryopreservation can induce osmotic stress, leading to a 15 to 20% loss of RBCs during freezing/thawing and cryoprotectant addition/removal. This study investigated how the biological aging of RBCs influences their osmotic characteristics. We hypothesized that biologically older RBCs (O-RBCs) would exhibit diminished osmotic features compared to biologically younger RBCs (Y-RBCs), thereby contributing to their loss during cryopreservation. Seven red cell concentrates (RCCs) were pooled, and their density profile was determined using Percoll separation. Y-RBCs and O-RBCs, representing the extremes of the density spectrum, were isolated. Rheological parameters (O<sub>hyper</sub>, EI<sub>max</sub>, EI<sub>hyper,</sub> K<sub>EI</sub>) were measured with laser ektacytometry. Osmotic fragility and hemolysis tests were performed to assess subpopulation responses to osmotic stress. Water (L<sub>p</sub>) and solute permeability (P<sub>s</sub>) of these subpopulations, in addition to unseparated RBCs (U-RBCs), were measured using stopped-flow spectroscopy. Aliquots of Y- and O-RBCs were differentially labeled with biotin and spiked back into a pooled unit. The pooled unit was split into five, and cryopreserved via a high glycerol/slow-cooling method, a standard method adopted by international blood banks. Glycerolization and deglycerolization were conducted using the Haemonetics ACP 215 Automated Cell Processor. Flow cytometry was used to assess the recovery of biotinylated RBCs (BioRBCs) before glycerolization and following post-thaw deglycerolization on days 1 and 14. O-RBCs exhibited the highest rigidity (K<sub>EI</sub>) and lowest O<sub>hyper</sub>, EI<sub>max</sub>, and EI<sub>hyper</sub>. Osmotic hemolysis and osmotic fragility indicated that O-RBCs exhibited superior tolerance to hypotonic solutions than Y- and U-RBCs (P &lt; 0.05). O-RBCs demonstrated significantly higher L<sub>p</sub> values than Y-RBCs across hypo- and hypertonic conditions (P &lt; 0.05). O-RBCs had the highest P<sub>s</sub> during deglycerolization (P &lt; 0.05). Y- and O-BioRBCs showed a stable trend throughout the 14 days of hypothermic storage (1-4°C) post-deglycerolization, with no significant difference between subpopulations. The study revealed that biological aging is associated with alterations in the osmotic and rheological properties of RBCs. Despite notable differences in osmotic characteristics, under the test conditions, survival rates of Y- and O-BioRBCs remained comparable after 14 days of hypothermic storage. These findings potentially support that tailoring cryopreservation protocols to specific RBC subpopulations can improve recovery rates and make cryopreservation more clinically efficient and broadly applicable. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955662/ """,
""" 39823202: The antibacterial agent Bio-AMS is metabolized in vivo through hydrolysis of the central acyl-sulfamide linker leading to high clearance and release of a moderately cytotoxic metabolite M1. Herein, we disclose analogues designed to prevent the metabolism of the central acyl-sulfamide moiety through steric hindrance or attenuation of the acyl-sulfamide electrophilicity. Bio-9 was identified as a metabolically stable analogue with a single-digit nanomolar dissociation constant for biotin protein ligase (BPL) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus ranging from 0.2 to 20 μM. The antibacterial activity of Bio-9 was dependent on BPL expression level and was more than 70-fold better against a strain underexpressing BPL and, conversely, more than 5-fold less effective against a strain overexpressing BPL. Pharmacokinetic and metabolic studies demonstrated that Bio-9 was metabolically stable in vivo, showing negligible hydrolysis that translated to substantially reduced clearance and concomitantly boosted drug exposure and half-life compared to Bio-AMS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39823202/ """,
""" 39836750: Chronic exposure to manganese (Mn) induces manganism and has been widely implicated as a contributing environmental factor to Parkinson's disease (PD), featuring notable overlaps between the two in motor symptoms and clinical hallmarks. Here, we developed an adult Drosophila model of Mn toxicity that recapitulated key parkinsonian features, spanning behavioral deficits, neuronal loss, and dysfunctions in lysosomes and mitochondria. Metabolomics analysis of the brain and body tissues of these flies at an early stage of toxicity identified systemic changes in the metabolism of biotin (also known as vitamin B<sub>7</sub>) in Mn-treated groups. Biotinidase-deficient flies showed exacerbated Mn-induced neurotoxicity, parkinsonism, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Supplementing the diet of wild-type flies with biotin ameliorated the pathological phenotypes of concurrent exposure to Mn. Biotin supplementation also ameliorated the pathological phenotypes of three standard fly models of PD. Furthermore, supplementing the culture media of human induced stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated midbrain dopaminergic neurons with biotin protected against Mn-induced mitochondrial dysregulation, cytotoxicity, and neuronal loss. Last, analysis of the expression of genes encoding biotin-related proteins in patients with PD revealed increased amounts of biotin transporters in the substantia nigra compared with healthy controls, suggesting a potential role of altered biotin metabolism in PD. Together, our findings identified changes in biotin metabolism as underlying Mn neurotoxicity and parkinsonian pathology in flies, for which dietary biotin supplementation was preventative. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39836750/ """,

""" 39732258: Litter size in pigs is affected by factors such as ovulation number, embryonic survival, and uterine environment conditions. Endometrial epithelial and stromal cells represent the first site of contact between the embryo and sows; therefore, dynamic changes in the growth and development of these cells are among the major factors affecting the intrauterine environment and implantation. Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1B (BMPR1B) is a receptor of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family that has been identified as a candidate gene for reproductive traits in pigs. In our previous study, we used whole-genome resequencing to identify BMPR1B as a candidate gene affecting sow litter size in Taihu pigs and revealed the transcriptional regulation of BMPR1B in the endometrium. However, the functional role of BMPR1B in the growth and development of the endometrium in pigs has not been comprehensively elucidated. In this study, we isolated, characterized, and immortalized Meishan pig endometrial cells, and systematically explored the biological function of BMPR1B using a cell model. BMPR1B promoted cell proliferation and migration of endometrial stromal cells but inhibited that of endometrial epithelial cells. Transcriptome sequencing revealed potential pathways through which BMPR1B influences the growth and development of endometrial cells, including vascular system development, gland morphology, cell migration and adhesion, and reproductive system development. Moreover, the outstanding uterine function of Meishan pigs from endometrial genomic aspects was performed elucidated through CUT&Tag experiments. Most biological processes, including reproductive system development, embryonic morphogenesis, and angiogenesis, were enriched by genes that were differentially bound by enhancer markers. These findings provide a valuable resource for future research on the mechanisms underlying the excellent uterine function in Meishan pigs. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39732258/ """,
""" 39955647: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of T cells defined by the expression of Forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3) playing a crucial role in regulating effector T cell activity. Tregs accumulate in the tumor microenvironment facilitating tumor growth. Thus, targeting FoxP3+ Tregs could improve cancer immunotherapies. Here, we conducted a high-throughput, phenotypic screening of a drug repurposing library to identify compounds downregulating FoxP3 expression in human primary T cells. We identified the tyrosine kinase inhibitor bosutinib and the STAT3 inhibitor nifuroxazide effectively downregulating FoxP3 expression. To identify more potent compounds, structural analogs of these two compounds were searched and validated. These analogs were found to reduce FoxP3 expression in a similar- or more potent manner than the original hits. All compounds inhibited Treg suppressive functions and reduced the expression of Treg activation markers. Importantly, bosutinib disrupted FAK and CaMKII signaling more potently in Tregs, whilst nifuroxazide and its analog NA16 targeted STAT3 protein levels more effectively in Tregs. Additionally, bosutinib and NA16 targeted effector Tregs more effectively than other Treg subsets. In summary, bosutinib, nifuroxazide, and their analogs inhibited FoxP3 expression, Treg suppressive abilities, and Treg activation effectively, which could serve as tools for the improvement of current cancer immunotherapies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955647/ """,
""" 39560668: Inhibition of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BDK or BCKDK), a negative regulator of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, is hypothesized to treat cardio-metabolic diseases. From a starting point with potential idiosyncratic toxicity risk, modification to a benzothiophene core and discovery of a cryptic pocket allowed for improved potency with 3-aryl substitution to arrive at PF-07328948, which was largely devoid of protein covalent binding liability. This BDK inhibitor was shown also to be a BDK degrader in cells and in vivo rodent studies. Plasma biomarkers, including BCAAs and branched-chain ketoacids (BCKAs), were lowered in vivo with enhanced pharmacodynamic effect upon chronic dosing due to BDK degradation. This molecule improves metabolic and heart failure end points in rodent models. PF-07328948 is the first known selective BDK inhibitor candidate to be examined in clinical studies, with Phase 1 single ascending dose data showing good tolerability and a pharmacokinetic profile commensurate with once-daily dosing. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39560668/ """,
""" 39212098: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) play vital roles in metabolic and physiological processes, with their catabolism initiated by two branched-chain aminotransferase isozymes: cytosolic (BCATc) and mitochondrial (BCATm). These enzymes have tissue and cell-specific compartmentalization and are believed to shuttle metabolites between cells and tissues. Although their expression and localization have been established in most tissues, ocular tissues remain unknown. In this study, we used immunohistochemical analyses to investigate the expression and localization of BCAT enzymes in the normal eye tissues. As expected, BCATc was highly expressed in the neuronal cells of the retina, particularly in the ganglion cell layers, inner nuclear layer, and plexiform layer, with little to no expression in Müller cells. BCATc was also present in the cornea, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), choroid, ciliary body, and iris but not in the lens. In contrast, BCATm was expressed across all ocular tissues, with strong expression in the Muller cells of the retina, the endothelial and epithelial layers of the cornea, the choroid and iris, and the epithelial cells at the lens's front. The extensive expression and distribution of BCAT isozymes in the ocular tissue, suggests that BCAA transamination is widespread in the eye, potentially aiding in metabolite transport between ocular tissues. The findings provide new insights into the physiological role of BCATs in the eye, particularly within the neuronal retina. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39212098/ """,
""" 39791161: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential amino acids for humans and play an indispensable role in many physiological and pathological processes. Branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of BCAAs. BCAT is upregulated in many cancers and implicated in the development and progress of some other diseases, such as metabolic and neurological diseases; and therefore, targeting BCAT might be a potential therapeutic approach for these diseases. There are two isoforms of BCAT, i.e., cytoplasmic BCAT1 (or BCATc) and mitochondrial BCAT2 (or BCATm). The discovery of BCAT inhibitors was initiated by Warner-Lambert, a subsidiary of Pfizer, in 2000, followed by many other pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Ergon, Icagen, Agios, and Bayer. Strategies of high-throughput screening (HTS), DNA-Encoded library technology (ELT), and fragment-based screening (FBS) have been employed for hit identification, followed by structural optimization. Despite low selectivity, both BCAT1 and BCAT2 selective inhibitors were individually developed, each with a few chemical structural classes. The most advanced BCAT1 inhibitor is BAY-069, discovered by Bayer, which has a potent enzymatic inhibitory activity against BCAT1 and a decent in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic profile but displayed weaker cellular inhibitory activity and almost no anti-proliferative activity. There are no BCAT inhibitors currently under investigation in clinical trials. Further studies are still needed to discover BCAT inhibitors with a more druggable profile for proof of concept. This review focuses on the latest progress of studies on the understanding of the physiology and pathology of BCAT and the discovery and development of BCAT inhibitors. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) and the druggability, and the challenges of BCAT inhibitors are discussed, with the aim of inspiring the discovery and development of BCAT inhibitors in the future. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39791161/ """,
""" 39931057: BCR-ABL kinase is the major oncogenic driver of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which are highly potent in targeting BCR-ABL, are currently used as first-line treatment. Although TKIs are effective, drug resistance caused by the emergence of drug-selected secondary mutations in BCR-ABL remains a major problem for relapse, especially in patients with compound mutations. In this study, we aimed to investigate potential neoepitopes derived from mutated BCR-ABL and to generate neoepitope-specific TCRs for adoptive T cell therapy. Two candidate peptides derived from the E255V and the T315I mutation (designated ABL-E255V and ABL-T315I) were selected for study based on their in silico predicted binding affinity to HLA-A2. By immunizing transgenic mice that express a diverse human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire restricted to HLA-A2, we detected CD8+ T cell responses against the ABL-E255V, but not the ABL-T315I peptide. From immune responding mice, two E255V-specific TCRs were isolated. Human CD8+ T cells were engineered to express the specific TCRs for characterization, in which one TCR was identified as a therapeutic candidate due to its superior avidity and lack of detectable off-target reactivity. Importantly, we demonstrated that the ABL-E255V neoepitope was naturally processed and presented. In summary, our results demonstrate that HLA-A2+ CML cells harboring the E255V mutation can be targeted by specific TCRs, which may benefit patients who are highly resistant to available TKIs due to compound mutations. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39931057/ """,
