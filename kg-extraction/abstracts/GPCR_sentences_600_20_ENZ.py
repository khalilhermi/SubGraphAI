""" 39568533: We present the case of a man in his 70s who developed acute confusion from hypertensive encephalopathy triggered by indomethacin. He was recently prescribed indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for headaches. However, his headaches were in the context of worsening hypertension that was treated with trandolapril. The use of indomethacin consequently worsened his underlying condition. On presentation to the emergency department, his blood pressure was 190/110 mmHg. Bloodwork including electrolytes, glucose, metabolic studies, renal and liver function were within normal limits; infectious workup including blood and urine cultures subsequently returned negative; and brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no acute process to explain his presentation. Indomethacin was discontinued and the patient's hypertension was treated with amlodipine. Both his confusion and underlying headaches resolved as his blood pressure normalized. The patient was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy triggered by indomethacin. NSAID use can trigger blood pressure decompensation, especially in patients with underlying hypertension; this effect is particularly pronounced in patients treated with anti-hypertensive medications that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) system.

""" 39899938: Identifying the molecules that control neural stem cell (NSC) fate would revolutionize treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Histone lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A) demethylates the mono- and di-methyl groups of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3K9 and plays an essential role in NSC proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of Seclidemstat (SP-2577), a reversible KDM1A inhibitor, and tranylcypromine (TCP), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and recently known as an irreversible histone lysine demethylase 1A inhibitor, on NSCs. SP-2577 and TCP increased glial fibrillary acidic protein expression (GFAP), decreased βIII-tubulin (TUBB3) expression, and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in rat NSCs. SP-2577 and TCP enhanced the transcription of Gfap and reduced Tubb3 transcription. Furthermore, SP-2577 increased the transcription levels of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, while TCP induced the transcription level of fibroblast growth factor 2. Therefore, we show that the KDM1A inhibitors, SP-2577 and TCP, induce astrocytogenesis in rat NSCs.

""" 39932761: Insomnia is a prevalent public health issue, characterized by dissatisfaction with the duration, continuity, and quality of sleep. It is closely associated with daytime symptoms, which are essential for diagnosing insomnia disorder. The condition is more common among women, middle-aged and older adults, and individuals with coexisting mental or physical health conditions. Evidence suggests that insomnia increases the risk of various health problems. Addressing insomnia is therefore crucial not only to enhance patients' quality of life but also to mitigate its significant health, social, and economic impacts. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insomnia treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults. When CBT-I proves ineffective or is unavailable, pharmacological treatments may be considered. Benzodiazepines (BZs) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) are suitable for short-term treatment (up to 4 weeks). Among BZs, triazolam is notable for its short half-life and demonstrated efficacy in treating sleep-onset and middle-of-the-night (MOTN) insomnia, supported by robust clinical evidence. Additionally, triazolam does not impair psychomotor performance. In certain cases, longer-term use of BZs or BZRAs may be appropriate; however, this approach requires careful individual assessment of the benefits and risks. Non-nightly use of hypnotic medications may also be a viable option for patients who do not require nightly treatment. Low-dose sedating antidepressants may be considered for short-term insomnia management (off-label), while antipsychotics and antihistamines are not recommended for this purpose. Orexin receptor antagonists are an option for treating insomnia for up to three months. It is important to note that although insomnia guidelines are based on daily use as evaluated in randomized controlled trials, clinical practice may vary. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39932761/ """,

""" 39943185: Trilostane is a drug able to block the synthesis of progesterone from pregnenolone, dependent on the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase. As a consequence of this effect, it is used to treat endocrinological diseases such as Cushing's syndrome, especially in dogs. Because of the modulatory effects of trilostane on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, trilostane administration causes an increase in brain levels of neurosteroids with anticonvulsant properties, as in the case of allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone is also of interest in curing depression, suggesting that trilostane might represent a tool to address neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we investigated the historical development of this drug and its current use, mechanisms, and possible developments. By searching the literature from 1978 to 2025, we identified 101 papers describing studies with trilostane. Precisely, 55 were about dogs and trilostane, 3 were on cats, and 23 were with other animals. Some studies (15) were also designed with human patients. The main disease treatment with trilostane was hyperadrenocorticism. However, we also found two preclinical papers on trilostane's potential use in psychiatric diseases and three on trilostane's potential use in neurological disorders.

Both mouse lines displayed slow bowel transit in vivo that worsened with age. Although the ENS appeared to develop normally in these mice, there was a progressive and profound loss of myenteric plexus neurons accompanied by changes in enteric glia in adult mice. Similar pathology was evident in colon autopsy material from a child with CLN1 disease. Neonatal administration of adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy prevented bowel transit defects, ameliorated loss of enteric neurons, and extended survival in mice. Treatment after weaning was less effective than treating neonatally but still extended the lifespan of CLN1 disease mice.

Early identification of runners at high risk of subsequent BSI could improve prevention strategies.

In a study of 30 female recreational athletes with tibial BSIs, 10 experienced additional BSIs over a 1-year period, prompting investigation of systemic biomarkers of subsequent BSIs using aptamer-based proteomic technology. We hypothesized that early proteomic signatures could discriminate runners who experienced subsequent BSIs. 1,500 proteins related to metabolic, immune, and bone healing pathways were examined. Using supervised machine learning and genetic programming methods, we analyzed serum protein signatures over the 1-year monitoring period. Models were also created with clinical metrics, including standard-of-care blood analysis, bone density measures, and health histories. Protein signatures collected within three weeks of BSI diagnosis achieved the greatest separation by sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA), clustering single and recurrent BSI individuals with a mean accuracy of 96 ± 0.02%.

Both sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) and SPHK2 are known to regulate the proliferation-inducing compound S-1-P. However, SPHK2 is more critical in cancer pathogenesis. The goal of this project was to investigate the potential antitumor effects of upamostat and opaganib, individually and in combination, on cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) xenografts in nude mice. PAX165, a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a surgically resected CCA, expresses substantial levels of SPHK2, PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3. Four groups of 18 mice each were treated with upamostat, opaganib, both, or vehicle. Mouse weights and PAX165 tumor volumes were measured. Tumor volumes in the upamostat, opaganib, and upamostat plus opaganib groups were significantly decreased compared to the control group. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38473407/ """,
""" 39237116: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the standards of care of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) treatment, though PPI response rates are variable ranging from 23 to 63% in pediatric studies. We sought to determine if expression of select genes in esophageal mucosa can predict PPI responsiveness in EoE. Children with a new diagnosis of EoE (15 or more eosinophils/hpf on esophageal biopsy) were prospectively treated with 8 weeks of PPI therapy before follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Children with <15 eosinophils/hpf on follow-up were classified as having PPI-Responsive EoE (PPI-R) and ≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf as PPI-Nonresponsive EoE (PPI-NR). Using the Nanostring nCounter Analysis System, mRNA expression of a custom panel of genes was measured in esophageal biopsies. Immunohistochemical staining of biopsies was performed. Among children with EoE, 32% (8/25) had PPI-R EoE. ATP12A, ATP4A, tryptase-beta 2 (TPSB2), CLC and IL13 had higher expression in PPI-NR EoE compared to PPI-R EoE or controls. Immunohistochemical staining of ATP12A was higher among PPI-R EoE and PPI-NR EoE, compared to non-EoE controls. In this study, PPI-NR EoE had significantly higher baseline gene expression of mast cell, cytokine, proton pump, and eosinophil genes compared to PPI-R EoE. PPIs may be involved in an inflammatory cascade of mast cell activation that stimulates IL-13 release, which upregulates ATP12A and ATP4A that leads to eosinophil recruitment. Histologic PPI failure may occur when increased gene expression of these components is high and cannot be overcome pharmacologically, especially in the case of proton pump genes. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39237116/ """,

""" 39515413: Several laboratories, including ours, have employed the Slc25a47tm1c(EUCOMM)Hmgu mouse model to investigate the role of SLC25A47, a hepatocyte-specific mitochondrial carrier, in regulating hepatic metabolism and systemic physiology. In this study, we reveal that the hepatic and systemic phenotypes observed following recombination of the Slc25a47-Wars1 locus in hepatocytes are primarily driven by the unexpected downregulation of Wars1, the cytosolic tryptophan aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase located adjacent to Slc25a47. While the downregulation of Wars1 predictably affects cytosolic translation, we also observed a significant impairment in mitochondrial protein synthesis within hepatocytes. This disturbance in mitochondrial function leads to an activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), a critical component of the mitochondrial stress response (MSR). Our findings clarify the distinct roles of Slc25a47 and Wars1 in maintaining both systemic and hepatic metabolic homeostasis.

Bifidobacterium longum subsp. iuvenis (Bl. iuvenis) is a newly identified subspecies found in the intestines of infants, and its functions, components and metabolites have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that Bl. iuvenis YSG is highly efficient in reducing UVB-induced melanin production in melanocytes. Through differential metabolomics analysis, we identified the metabolites 5-hydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid and aconitic acid as Bl. iuvenis YSG-specific anti-melanogenic substances. Bl. iuvenis YSG potently inhibited melanogenesis by downregulating melanogenic enzymes and directly acting on tyrosinase active sites. Furthermore, B. longum inhibited ROS generation in keratinocytes through its metabolite glycolic acid, increasing the levels of elastin, collagen III and collagen XVII in fibroblasts. We demonstrated that Bl. iuvenis YSG-derived fermentation components not only reduced the number of sunburn cells in UV-irradiated reconstituted human epidermis but also ameliorated ECM damage and epidermal atrophy in ex vivo human epidermis. Our results suggest that mixed metabolites derived from Bl. iuvenis synergistically contribute to antiphotoaging effects, specifically through the production of specific organic acids.

""" 39952526: Phenolic acids (rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B, etc.) in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge possess significant pharmacological activity and thus have high medicinal and economic value. Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT, EC 2.6.1.5) is one of the key enzymes in the phenolic acid metabolic pathway, and the biological function and regulatory mechanism of its family member SmTAT2 have not been reported in S. miltiorrhiza. Through a transgenic assay (Overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9), we demonstrated that SmTAT2 can positively regulate the accumulation of phenolic acid. By using molecular interaction (Yeast single hybrid, Dual-LUC and EMSA) and transgenic technologies, we demonstrated that SmNAC36 first activates the transcription of SmMYB18, and SmMYB18 subsequently activates the expression of the target gene SmTAT2 to promote phenolic acid biosynthesis. Moreover, SmNAC36 can directly activate the transcription of SmTAT2. The molecular mechanism underlying the induced synthesis and accumulation of phenolic acid in Salvia miltiorrhiza by NAC36-MYB18-TAT2 molecular model is revealed.

Emerging areas of drug development include cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies. However, cost, accessibility, toxicity, and the need for either prolonged or repeated hospitalization prevent universal application of these therapies. Given this area of unmet clinical need, we present this review article on Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) degraders in patients with CLL/SLL. We focus on their development as a drug class, the up-to-date clinical data available, as well as future directions. BTK protein degraders are a novel drug class with an alternate mechanism of action (MOA), compared to cBTKis and non-covalent BTKis (ncBTKis), causing ubiquitination of BTK, thereby leading to its degradation through the proteasome. Encouraging pre-clinical data show that this MOA allows BTK protein degraders to overcome common BTK mutations. We focus on four agents which are under investigation in B-cell malignancies in early clinical trials: BGB-16673, NX-2127, NX-5948, and AC676. Preliminary data suggest a comparable safety and toxicity profile between agents across this drug class with many patients on phase 1 trials deriving durable clinical benefit. Optimal sequencing of BTK degraders in the therapeutic landscape of CLL/SLL treatment is yet to be established. Further trials investigating these agents in combination with other targeted CLL agents may help to further understand their applicability.

""" 39743031: c-Src, also known as cellular Src, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Its dysregulation has been implicated in the development and progression of several diseases, particularly cancer. Current therapeutic agents targeting c-Src are primarily small molecules binding to its kinase domain. However, drug resistance often reduces the effectiveness of these drugs. The SH3 domain of c-Src is a highly conserved functional region with a low propensity for developing drug resistance, whereas there are no existing anti-cancer drugs specifically binding to this domain. In this study, structure-based virtual screening and thermal shift experimental verification identified three molecules that showed potent binding affinity with SH3 domain of c-Src. Subsequent kinase activity assay validated the inhibitory activity of these compounds against c-Src, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 60.42 to 122.2 nM. Next, cell-level assays and preliminary study were conducted to further evaluate the efficacy of the identified active compounds.

In a previous study, we reported that PFOS modestly increases mast cell activation. However, its effects on FcεRI (a high-affinity IgE receptor)-mediated mast cell activation, a pivotal process in inflammatory allergic reactions and innate immunity, have not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the effects of PFOS on IgE/Ag (antigen)-stimulated mast cell activation and the underlying mechanisms using bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) mouse model. Oral administration of PFOS attenuated IgE/Ag-stimulated PCA responses. In the BMMCs model, PFOS reduced IgE/Ag-stimulated degranulation, intracellular Ca2+ levels, eicosanoid synthesis, and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consistently, PFOS decreased the phosphorylation of Syk and Lck, central tyrosine kinases in IgE/Ag-stimulated mast cell activation, along with their downstream signaling molecules (PLCγ1, AKT, and MAPKs), through the activation of tyrosine phosphatase Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1. Additionally, PFOS reduced the phosphorylation of FcεRI-associated tyrosine kinases Fyn and Lyn. Fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed reduced fluorine signals of PFOS upon interaction with the plasma membrane, suggesting that PFOS accumulates in plasma membranes and interferes with FcεRI signaling by acting upstream, close to the membrane. Moreover, PFOS attenuated lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mRNA expression of TNFα and IL-6.

An increasing number of studies have highlighted the critical role of tumor microenvironment (TME) imbalances, particularly immune escape due to impaired chemokine-mediated trafficking, in tumorigenesis and progression. Notably, CC chemokines (CCLs) have been shown to either promote or inhibit angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune responses in tumors, thereby influencing cancer development and patient outcomes. However, the diagnostic and prognostic significance of CCLs in CRC remains unclear. In this study, multiple online tools for bioinformatics analyses were utilized. The findings revealed that the mRNA expression levels of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL26 were significantly elevated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, whereas CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CCL21, and CCL28 mRNA levels were markedly downregulated. Additionally, dysregulation of CCL4, CCL5, and CCL21 was strongly associated with clinical staging, and elevated levels of CCL4, CCL11, and CCL28 were linked to significantly prolonged survival in CRC patients. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the cellular roles of CCLs were predominantly associated with the chemokine, Wnt, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways, as well as protein kinase activity. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation of most CCLs involved RELA and NFKB1. Key downstream targets included members of the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (HCK, LYN, and LCK), serine/threonine kinases (ATR and ATM), and others such as CSNK1G2, NEK2, and CDK2. Moreover, CCLs (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL21, and CCL28) exhibited strong correlations with major infiltration-related immune cells, including B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells.

This isoform is distinct from somatic GAPDH, not only in being specific for the testis but also because it contains an additional amino-terminal region that encodes a proline-rich motif that is known to bind to the fibrous sheath of the sperm tail. By conducting a large-scale sequence comparison on low-complexity sequences available in databases, we identified a strong similarity between the proline-rich motif from GAPDHS and the proline-rich sequence from Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-like (EVL), which is known to bind an SH3 domain of dynamin-binding protein (DNMBP). The putative binding partners of the proline-rich GAPDHS motif include SH3 domain-binding protein 4 (SH3BP4) and the IL2-inducible T-cell kinase/tyrosine-protein kinase ITK/TSK (ITK). This result implies that GAPDHS participates in specific signal-transduction pathways. Gene Ontology category-enrichment analysis showed several functional classes shared by both proteins, of which the most interesting ones are related to signal transduction and regulation of hydrolysis.

Phillyrin (PHN) has been reported to have anticancer effects, but the anticancer mechanism in liver cancer is ominous. By searching the potential target of PHN in the online database and liver cancer disease database, it was found that there is only one overlap gene, and DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) is abnormally expressed in liver cancer tissues. TOP2A overexpression and downregulated hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were then constructed in vitro, and it was examined whether PHN treatment induced ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating TOP2A's inhibition of Janus kinase 2/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway through phenotypic assay, western blot assay, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR assay and electron microscopy. The results showed that PHN could inhibit the expression of TOP2A protein and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in hepatoma cells. PHN could also downregulate glutathione peroxidase 4 by suppressing the expression of TOP2A protein. PHN impeded the activity of factor inhibiting hypoxia‑inducible factor 1 alpha, thereby augmenting the synthesis of iron‑dependent apoptosis‑related proteins including cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, long‑chain acyl‑CoA synthetase family member 4 and NADPH oxidase 1, thus facilitating an increase in Fe2+ concentration and accelerating oxidative harm within hepatocellular carcinoma cells, culminating in the induction of ferroptotic cell death in these liver malignancy cells. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39950325/ """,

Additionally, we illustrated that KM UCAR-T cells displayed anti-tumor activity in a xenograft murine model and verified the expansion and cytotoxicity of KM UCAR-T over traditional UCAR-T in the presence of allogeneic PBMCs when treated with dasatinib in vivo. These findings offer a novel strategy for UCAR-T cells to resist host immune rejection and achieve sustained expansion. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39935177/ """,

Unlike other TKIs, bosutinib's lack of inhibition of c-KIT and PDGFR may contribute to its unique tolerability profile. Similar to dasatinib, it targets Bcr/Abl and SRC kinases, particularly Lyn, raising safety concerns. In fact, the susceptibility of Lyn -/- mice to autoimmune disorders and the deregulation of Lyn-dependent pathways in patients with lupus were previously shown. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39910922/ """,

""" 39941817: Background: A hallmark of cancer is the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Immunosuppressive M2 macrophages (MΦs) in the TME facilitate escape from immune surveillance and promote tumor growth; therefore, TME-induced immunosuppression is a potent immunotherapeutic approach to treating cancer. Methods: Cancer cell-secreted proteins were detected by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were used to assess which proteins were involved in MΦs polarization and differentiation. The protein-protein interaction was characterized using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Cancer-secreted heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) protein was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MΦ polarization and tumor growth were assessed in vivo with subcutaneous LLC-GFP tumor models and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) knockout mice; in vitro assessments were conducted using TLR2 knockout and both LLC-GFP and LN227 lentiviral-mediated knockdown (KD) cells. Results: Cancer cells released a secreted form of Hsp70 that acted on MΦ TLR2 to upregulate Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MerTK) and induce MΦ M2 polarization. Hsp70 nAbs led to a reduction in CD14 expression by 75% in THP-1 cells in response to Gli36 EMD-CM. In addition, neutralizing TLR2 nAbs resulted in a 30% and 50% reduction in CD14 expression on THP-1 cells in response to MiaPaCa-2 and Gli36 exosome/microparticle-depleted conditioned media (EMD-CMs), respectively. Hsp70, TLR2, and MerTK formed a protein complex. Tumor growth and intra-tumor M2 MΦs were significantly reduced upon cancer cell Hsp70 knockdown and in TLR2 knockout mice. Conclusions: Cancer-secreted Hsp70 interacts with TLR2, upregulates MerTK on MΦs, and induces immunosuppressive MΦ M2 polarization. This previously unreported action of secreted Hsp70 suggests that disrupting the Hsp70-TLR2-MerTK interaction could serve as a promising immunotherapeutic approach to mitigate TME immunosuppression in solid cancers. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39941817/ """,

STYK1 plays an important role in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis in various cancers. By analyzing the expression of RTKs in immune cells in the database of 2013 Immunological Genome Project, we found that STYK1 was principally expressed in NK cells. In order to investigate the function of STYK1, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate STYK1-deleted mice, we found STYK1 deletion mice have normal number, development, and function of NK cells in spleen and bone marrow in tumor-free resting state. To examine the tumor surveillance of STYK1 in vivo, we utilized a variety of tumor models, including NK cell-specific target cell (ß2M and RMA-S) clearance experiments in vivo, subcutaneous and intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma model, and the spontaneous breast cancer model MMTV-PyMT. Surprisingly, we discovered that deletion of the oncogenic STYK1 promoted the four-model tumor progression, and we observed a reduction of NK cell accumulation in the tumor tissues of STYK1 deletion mice compared to WT mice. In order to study the mechanism of STYK1 in NK, RNA sequence of STYK1-/- and WT NK have unveiled a disparity in the signaling pathways linked to migration and adhesion in STYK1-/- NK cells. Further analysis of chemokine receptors associated with NK cell migration revealed that STYK1-deficient NK cells exhibited a significant reduction in CCR2 expression. The STYK1 expression was negatively associated with tumor progression in glioma patients. Overall, our study found the expression of STYK1 in NK cell mediates NK cell anti-tumor response through regulating CCR2 and infiltrating into tumor tissue. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39415235/ """,
""" 37020040: Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies. Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has so far only shown modest efficacy in ovarian cancer and platinum-based chemotherapy remains the front-line treatment. Development of platinum resistance is one of the most important factors contributing to ovarian cancer recurrence and mortality. Through kinome-wide synthetic lethal RNAi screening combined with unbiased datamining of cell line platinum response in CCLE and GDSC databases, here we report that Src-Related Kinase Lacking C-Terminal Regulatory Tyrosine And N-Terminal Myristylation Sites (SRMS), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is a novel negative regulator of MKK4-JNK signaling under platinum treatment and plays an important role in dictating platinum efficacy in ovarian cancer. Suppressing SRMS specifically sensitizes p53-deficient ovarian cancer cells to platinum in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SRMS serves as a sensor for platinum-induced ROS. Platinum treatment-induced ROS activates SRMS, which inhibits MKK4 kinase activity by directly phosphorylating MKK4 at Y269 and Y307, and consequently attenuates MKK4-JNK activation. Suppressing SRMS leads to enhanced MKK4-JNK-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting MCL1 transcription, thereby boosting platinum efficacy. Importantly, through a drug repurposing strategy, we uncovered that PLX4720, a small molecular selective inhibitor of B-RafV600E, is a novel SRMS inhibitor that can potently boost platinum efficacy in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, targeting SRMS with PLX4720 holds the promise to improve the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy and overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020040/ """,

Phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1), a membrane-associated enzyme, is of paramount importance for the differentiation of myoblasts and the normal functioning of muscle tissue. In recent years, both of these genes have been reported to be associated with the economic traits of animals. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TXK and PLCE1 genes and growth traits in Ashidan yaks and to search for potential molecular marker loci that can influence Ashidan yak breeding. A cGPS liquid microarray was utilized to genotype 232 Ashidan yaks and to analyze correlations between two SNP loci in the TXK and PLCE1 genes and yak body weight, body height, body length, and chest circumference at different periods. The results indicated that the g.55,999,531C&gt;T locus of the TXK gene and the g.342,350T&gt;G locus of the PLCE1 gene were significantly correlated with the growth traits of Ashidan yaks. Among these, individuals with the CC genotype at the g.55,999,531C&gt;T locus showed a significantly higher body length at 6 months old compared to TT individuals, and those with the CT genotype at 12 months old had a significantly higher chest circumference than TT individuals. At the g.342,350T&gt;G locus, the body height of GG genotype individuals at 18 months of age was significantly higher than that of TT genotype individuals and TG genotype individuals.

""" 39894064: An early step in the activation of T cells via the T cell antigen receptor is the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) by the TEC family tyrosine kinase, interleukin-2 (IL-2) inducible T cell kinase (ITK). PLC-γ1 activation occurs within a multi-protein complex comprised of the enzymes ITK, PLC-γ1, and VAV, and the adapter molecules, LAT, Gads, SLP-76, and NCK. Studies of ITK activation and the role of this heptameric complex in regulating ITK activation and function have not been possible due to the lack of success in the expression and purification of full-length, monomeric ITK protein. In this study, we have produced soluble full-length wild-type ITK protein by co-expressing an N-terminal solubility-tagged ITK construct with a kinase-specific co-chaperone CDC37 in an insect cell line. Although the majority of the purified ITK protein is oligomerized, there is a 13-fold increase in the yield of monomeric protein production compared to the last reported purification. Previous studies suggest that the ITK oligomerization is mediated by intermolecular interactions. We created several mutants to disrupt these self-associations. Expression of one of these, the C96E/T110I mutant, produced 20 times more monomer than the wild-type construct. The in vitro characterization of these protein constructs showed that the purified protein is stable and functional. This successful purification and in vitro characterization of full-length monomeric ITK protein will aid in understanding the mechanism by which ITK is recruited into the heptameric complex and is enabled to phosphorylate and activate PLC-γ1. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39894064/ """,

""" 39897049: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury can cause poor prognosis of liver transplantation and hepatectomy, especially in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Apoptosis is closely related to different stages of liver injury, and the death of hepatocytes caused by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria homeostasis perturbation may be key to liver injury. The receptor tyrosine kinases AXL encoded by the gene axl, is a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) family, which participates in various biological processes by binding to the ligand of growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6). However, whether AXL is involved in apoptosis pathways, and the detailed mechanism in hepatic I/R injury remains unknown. In the present study, we found that total AXL is up-regulated while phosphorylated AXL (p-AXL, the active form of AXL) was down-regulated after I/R in human liver tissues from liver transplantation. Consistently, total AXL was found up-regulated while p-AXL was down-regulated during hepatic I/R injury in mice. Pretreatment with Gas6 increased p-AXL expression, reduced ER stress-associated cell apoptosis, alleviated liver damage, and restored ER and mitochondria ultrastructure during hepatic I/R in mice. Furthermore, the ALD model was established by chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding to explore the role of AXL in I/R liver injury with ethanol-associated steatosis. We found that ALD mice had a lower p-AXL level and were more susceptible to hepatic I/R injury. Importantly, activated AXL ameliorated liver injury by inhibiting IRE1 and PERK pathway to reduce ER stress-associated apoptosis. In conclusion, activated AXL protects alcohol-associated steatotic liver against I/R injury by inhibiting ER stress and mitochondria-associated apoptosis, suggesting that targeting AXL serves as a potential strategy for liver I/R injury, particularly for marginal liver donors with alcohol-associated steatosis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39897049/ """,
""" 38820174: Primary lymphedema (PL), characterized by tissue swelling, fat accumulation, and fibrosis, results from defects in lymphatic vessels or valves caused by mutations in genes involved in development, maturation, and function of the lymphatic vascular system. Pathogenic variants in various genes have been identified in about 30% of PL cases. By screening of a cohort of 755 individuals with PL, we identified two TIE1 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin- and epidermal growth factor-like domains 1) missense variants and one truncating variant, all predicted to be pathogenic by bioinformatic algorithms. The TIE1 receptor, in complex with TIE2, binds angiopoietins to regulate the formation and remodeling of blood and lymphatic vessels. The premature stop codon mutant encoded an inactive truncated extracellular TIE1 fragment with decreased mRNA stability, and the amino acid substitutions led to decreased TIE1 signaling activity. By reproducing the two missense variants in mouse Tie1 via CRISPR/Cas9, we showed that both cause edema and are lethal in homozygous mice. Thus, our results indicate that TIE1 loss-of-function variants can cause lymphatic dysfunction in patients. Together with our earlier demonstration that ANGPT2 loss-of-function mutations can also cause PL, our results emphasize the important role of the ANGPT2/TIE1 pathway in lymphatic function. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38820174/ """,
""" 39395205: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with the FMS-related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutation have a poorer prognosis, and treatment with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been hindered by resistance mechanisms. One such mechanism is known as adaptive resistance, in which downstream signaling pathways are reactivated after initial inhibition. Past work has shown that FLT3/ITD cells undergo adaptive resistance through the reactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling within 24 h of sustained FLT3 inhibition. We investigated the mechanism(s) responsible for this ERK reactivation and hypothesized that targeting tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL), another receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in cancer resistance, may overcome the adaptive ERK reactivation. Experiments revealed that AXL is upregulated and activated in FLT3/ITD cell lines mere hours after commencing TKI treatment. AXL inhibition combined with FLT3 inhibition to decrease the ERK signal rebound and to exert greater anti-leukemia effects than with either treatment alone. Finally, we observed that TKI-induced AXL upregulation occurs in patient samples, and combined inhibition of both AXL and FLT3 increased efficacy in our in vivo models. Taken together, these data suggest that AXL plays a role in adaptive resistance in FLT3/ITD AML and that combined AXL and FLT3 inhibition might improve FLT3/ITD AML patient outcomes. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39395205/ """,

A small TDP1 subfamily, composed of TDP1α and TDP1β, is present in plants. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of the two TDP1 genes in the DDR context. Methods: A series of Arabidopsis thaliana DDR single and double mutants defective in the sog1, e2fb, pol2A, atm, and atr genes, treated with the genotoxic agents camptothecin (CPT, inhibitor of TopI) and NSC120686 (NSC, inhibitor of TDP1), were used. These compounds were specifically used due to their known impact on the TDP1 function. The effect of the treatments was assessed via phenotypic analyses that included germination percentage, speed, and seedling growth. Subsequently, the expression of the TDP1α and TDP1β genes was monitored through qRT-PCR. Results: Overall, the gathered data indicate that the atm mutant was highly sensitive to NSC120686, both phenotypically and concerning the TDP1α gene expression profiles. Alternatively, the upregulation of TDP1β in e2fb, pol2a, and atr supports its implication in the replication stress response.

Additionally, GALE interconverts UDP-N-Acetylgalactosamine and UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine. These four sugars are needed for glycosylation of biomolecules. GALE deletion is considered lethal, and all described patients carry hypomorphic mutations. Symptoms are diverse and can range from mild to severe, without effective treatment. We have previously generated a Caenorhabditis elegans model for type III galactosemia, which carries a hypomorphic mutation in the GALE gene homologue. In this model, we observed that the symptoms varied depending on the diet. The aim of this work is to identify which dietary metabolites might alleviate the symptoms of type III galactosemia. To identify the molecules responsible, we used a C. elegans model of type III galactosemia and a mouse model to test whether the respond to the treatment is conserved in mammals and thus could be a putative intervention in patients. We found that high levels of monosaccharides in the diet is responsible for the beneficial effect in the C. elegans model. This intervention generates an increase of gale-1 expression through activation of the insulin pathway which may explain the reduction of the symptoms in animals carrying hypomorphic mutations. The increase of the GALE gene expression after monosaccharides treatment is also conserved in mammals and if maintained in humans, monosaccharide treatment combined with monitorization of GALE expression could be included in the management of patients with type III galactosemia. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39549362/ """,
