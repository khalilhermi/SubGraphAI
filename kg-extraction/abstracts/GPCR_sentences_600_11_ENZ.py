Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DN and control samples were screened. Immune cell subtypes infiltration and immune score were figured out via different algorithms. Consensus clustering was performed by the Ward's method to determine different phenotypes of DN. CRG key genes between two phenotypes were identified via machine learning algorithm.

Via Consensus clustering based on cuproptosis CRG key genes, the DN samples were divided into cluster C1 and cluster C2. The cluster C1 was characterized by low cuproptosis CRG genes expression, high immune cell subtypes infiltration, and high enrichment of immune-related pathways. Cluster C2 was on the contrary, the Dicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductase (DCXR) and heat-responsive protein 12 (HRSP12) genes were related to clinical traits and the immune microenvironment, negatively correlated with most immune cell subtypes.

""" 39952752: The impact of three antimicrobial proteins (lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme) on the growth of cultures involved in cheesemaking and ripening was studied. Strains were grown in the optimal media growth of each strain or in cheese simulated environment. The media were supplemented with the antimicrobial proteins together (MIX; 1:1:1) or individually at concentrations found in milk (1x) and cheese (2.5x). Growth properties were evaluated using a novel approach by combining flow cytometry and spectrophotometric assay. Flow cytometry measures cell viability (live/injured/dead cells; total cells). Lactococcus cremoris CUC-C (starter culture) was stimulated by lactoperoxidase and lysozyme reaching higher optical density and total cells than control (without antimicrobial proteins). In cheese simulated environment, the live cells of L. cremoris CUC-C increased of more than 30% in the MIX condition without an increase in total cells. Flow cytometry allowed to show this protective effect. For cultures involved in ripening, the total cells of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ATCC 14917 and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. tolerans LMA-1802 decreased of 1 log in the MIX condition. Although the same log reduction, different inhibition behavior was observed. Live cells for Lpb. plantarum ATCC 14917 remained unchanged while for Lcb. paracasei LMA-1802, injured cells increased. These observations were only possible by flow cytometry. The higher concentration (2.5x) tended to decrease the growth properties (lower maximal rate, longer lag phase) of strains as compared to the lower one (1x). The strain-dependent sensitivity to the three antimicrobial proteins underlines the importance of evaluating their effect on cultures prior cheesemaking to ensure proper functionality. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39952752/ """,

Typical age of onset is eight to 19 years (peak: age14-16 years). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, atonic seizures, and focal seizures with impaired awareness may also occur. The course of the disease is characterized by increasing frequency and intractability of seizures. Status epilepticus with any of the seizure types is common. Cognitive decline becomes apparent at or soon after the onset of seizures. Dysarthria and ataxia appear early, while spasticity appears late. Emotional disturbances and confusion are common in the early stages of the disease and are followed by dementia.

However, UCAR-T cell therapy faces a challenge in the rapid elimination of allogeneic cells by the host immune system. To address this, we introduced a T316I mutation in the leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) locus in CAR-T cells using the cytosine base editor (CBE) system. Concurrently, we disrupted endogenous T-cell receptor alpha chain (TRAC) and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) with the CRISPR-Cas9 system, along with dasatinib to overcome host immune rejection, an Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor. The resulting LCK mutated UCAR-T (KM UCAR-T) cells exhibited normal phenotypes in activation, proliferation, differentiation, and tumor cytotoxicity in vitro. Moreover, KM UCAR-T cells demonstrated sustained expansion in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) when incubated with T-cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-mismatched donors upon dasatinib treatment. Additionally, we illustrated that KM UCAR-T cells displayed anti-tumor activity in a xenograft murine model and verified the expansion and cytotoxicity of KM UCAR-T over traditional UCAR-T in the presence of allogeneic PBMCs when treated with dasatinib in vivo. These findings offer a novel strategy for UCAR-T cells to resist host immune rejection and achieve sustained expansion. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39935177/ """,

However, benefit from corticosteroids in TBM may depend upon host leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H) genotype and the corresponding inflammatory phenotypes. This article describes the planned analyses for the primary publication of the results of the LAST ACT clinical trial (NCT03100786): 'Leukotriene A4 hydrolase Stratified Trial of Adjunctive Corticosteroids for HIV-negative adults with Tuberculous meningitis'. The primary hypothesis addressed by the trial is that LTA4H genotype, in particular CC or CT genotype, determines whether adjunctive dexamethasone benefits or harms adults with TBM. The trial was an LTA4H genotype stratified, parallel group, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre Phase III trial of dexamethasone given for 6-8 weeks in addition to standard anti-tuberculosis drugs. LTA4H genotype (CC, CT, TT) was determined in all participants prior to randomisation; only those with CC or CT genotype were randomised to dexamethasone or placebo. All TT genotype participants received dexamethasone because prior data indicated survival was increased by dexamethasone in this genotype. The primary endpoint was all-cause death or new neurological event over the first 12 months after randomisation. We took a hybrid trial-design approach which aims to prove non-inferiority of placebo first but also allows claiming superiority of placebo in case dexamethasone causes substantial harm.

Understanding the mechanisms behind CSCs generation and stemness maintenance is vital for early cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, we unveil that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is highly expressed in ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) and is essential for maintaining stemness by regulating lipid desaturation. Studies confirmed that CPT1A enhances SREBP1 activation, upregulating SCD1 expression, and promoting lipid desaturation in OCSCs. Mechanistic studies reveal that CPT1A promotes succinylation of mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) through its lysine succinyltransferase (LSTase) activity, crucial for mitochondria-associated membranes formation and SREBP1 activation. Inhibiting CPT1A's LSTase activity with Glyburide reduces OCSCs' stemness and enhances cisplatin's anti-tumor effects against ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.

Myocardial injury is a common complication associated with OSAS. Alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a potent antioxidant, has been utilized in various disease contexts and has demonstrated significant protective effects in myocardial infarction models. Given the limited treatment options available for OSAS-related myocardial injury, this study aimed to demonstrate the potential therapeutic effects of LA and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. IH is a widely employed method to simulate the pathophysiological conditions associated with OSAS. In vivo experiments were conducted using mice placed in a specialized hypoxic chamber to replicate IH conditions. Echocardiography indicated that exposure to IH severely impaired cardiac function. Treatment with LA activated the Nrf2 pathway and autophagy, which contributed to the improvement of cardiac function in mice with OSAS. Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrated that IH induced apoptosis and decreased cell viability in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. LA enhanced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its downstream signaling pathways, thereby promoting autophagy, inhibiting apoptosis, and alleviating injury in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, in vitro inhibition of Nrf2 using ML385 reduced autophagy levels and attenuated the protective effects of LA against apoptosis in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that LA may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for myocardial injury associated with OSAS. By elucidating these findings, new insights into the protective mechanisms of LA against IH-induced myocardial injury are provided, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for diseases associated with OSAS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954840/ """,

In this study, we investigate the role of histone lactylation at the AIM2 locus and its downstream effects on ferroptosis regulation and lung cancer progression. We utilized a combination of biochemical assays, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting to assess histone lactylation levels and gene expression. To evaluate the functional consequences, we employed gain- and loss-of-function approaches using shikonin treatment and siRNA knockdowns in lung cancer cell lines. Additionally, we assessed the impact of these interventions on ferroptosis markers and lung cancer cell viability. Our results reveal that increased histone lactylation at the AIM2 locus correlates with enhanced transcriptional activity of AIM2, leading to reduced ferroptosis through modulation of ACSL4 and STAT5B. Furthermore, we demonstrate that shikonin, a natural naphthoquinone derivative, effectively downregulates PKM2 and AIM2 expression, thereby inhibiting lung cancer progression by counteracting the effects of histone lactylation on AIM2 expression. These findings highlight the importance of histone lactylation in regulating AIM2 expression and ferroptosis in lung cancer cells.

""" 39919578: Due to the widespread use of loratadine (LOR) as an antihistamine, it is widely distributed in the environment as an emerging contaminant. However, its impact on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of LOR on the conjugative transfer of ARGs and elucidated the potential mechanisms through transcriptome analysis. The results showed that LOR significantly promoted the frequency of conjugative transfer up to 1.5- to 8.6-fold higher compared with the control group. Exposure to LOR increased reactive oxidative species (ROS) and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, leading to the upregulation of expression of genes related to transmembrane transport and SOS response. Meanwhile, it stimulated the increase of cell membrane permeability. Moreover, LOR exposure could enhance H+ efflux in donor bacteria, resulting in the decrease of intracellular pH and the elevation of transmembrane potential, which could induce the increase of ion transport, thereby promoting plasmid efflux from the cell membrane. Based on this, we inferred that LOR can induce an increase in ROS level and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and promoted the efflux of intracellular H+. This, in turn, triggered the intensification of various ion transport processes on the cell membrane, thereby increasing membrane permeability and accelerating plasmid efflux.

Characterized by both innate and adaptive immune responses, PsA poses significant challenges for effective treatment. Recent advances in drug delivery systems have sparked interest in developing novel formulations to improve therapeutic outcomes. The current research focuses on the development and evaluation of a nanosponge-loaded, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor-based topical gel for the treatment of PsA. Methods: Nanosponges (NSs) were prepared by using beta-cyclodextrin as a polymer and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a crosslinker by melting, and gels were prepared by employing carbopol and badam gum as polymers. Results: Solubility studies confirmed that the prepared nanosponges were highly soluble. FT-IR studies confirmed the formation of hydrogen bonds between lumiracoxib and beta-cyclodextrin. SEM confirmed that the prepared formulations were roughly spherical and porous in nature. The average particle size was 190.5 ± 0.02 nm, with a zeta potential of -18.9 mv. XRD studies showed that the crystallinity of lumiracoxib decreased after encapsulation, which helped to increase its solubility. The optimized nanosponges (NS2) were incorporated in an optimized gel (FG10) to formulate a nanosponge-loaded topical gel. The optimized gel formulation exhibited a homogeneous consistency, with a pH of 6.8 and a viscosity of 1.15 PaS, indicating its suitability for topical application and stability. The in vitro diffusion studies for the topical gel showed drug release of 82.32% in 24 h.

""" 39956875: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play crucial roles in cancer progression, immune evasion, drug resistance, and recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms behind CSCs generation and stemness maintenance is vital for early cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, we unveil that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is highly expressed in ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) and is essential for maintaining stemness by regulating lipid desaturation. Studies confirmed that CPT1A enhances SREBP1 activation, upregulating SCD1 expression, and promoting lipid desaturation in OCSCs. Mechanistic studies reveal that CPT1A promotes succinylation of mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) through its lysine succinyltransferase (LSTase) activity, crucial for mitochondria-associated membranes formation and SREBP1 activation. Inhibiting CPT1A's LSTase activity with Glyburide reduces OCSCs' stemness and enhances cisplatin's anti-tumor effects against ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.

""" 39630081: N6-acetyl-L-lysine residue is abundant in dietary protein but little is known about its potential influences on the diet-consumers. Herein, it is reported that Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KARS) mediates co-translational deposition of diet-derived N6-acetyl-L-lysine (AcK) in nascent proteins to contribute to the acetylome in cells. Acetylated dietary protein is a direct source of AcK that can widely and substantially regulate the acetylome in multiple organs of mice. By analyzing the mechanisms underlying AcK contributing to the acetylome in mammalian cells, it is found that KARS can utilize AcK as an alternative substrate to produce N6-acetyl-l-lysyl-tRNA. The crystal structure of KARS in complex with AcK at 2.26 Å resolution shows that AcK shares the same substrate-binding pocket as L-lysine, allowed by a sidechain flip of Tyr499. The generated N6-acetyl-L-lysyl-tRNA introduces AcK into growing nascent polypeptide and results in protein acetylation, including the regions buried inside folded proteins that are post-translational modification (PTM)-inaccessible and functionally important. This undocumented protein modification mechanism is inherently different from PTM and termed as co-translational modification (coTM). It is expected to extend the repertoire of acetylome and improve the understanding of protein modification mechanisms in cells. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39630081/ """,

Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase type 6 (ACP6) is a type of histidine acid phosphatase and plays an important role in regulating host inflammatory responses and anti-cancer effects in mammals. However, its function in teleost remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate ACP6 function in golden pompano. ACP6 from golden pompano was identified, cloned, and named TroACP6. The open reading frame of TroACP6 was 1275 bp in length, encoding 424 amino acids. The TroACP6 protein shared high sequence identity (43.32%-90.57 %) with the ACP6 of other species. It contained a histidine phosphatase domain with the active site motif RHGART and the catalytic dipeptide HD (histidine and aspartate). Meanwhile, TroACP6 mRNA was widely distributed in the various tissues of healthy golden pompano, with the maximum expression in the head kidney. The function of TroACP6 was analyzed both in vitro and in vivo, and the results revealed that the purified recombinant TroACP6 protein exhibited optimum phosphatase activity at pH 6.0 and 50 °C in vitro. Meanwhile, upon Edwardsiella tarda challenge, TroACP6 expression in tissues increased significantly in vivo. In addition, TroACP6 overexpression enhanced the respiratory burst activity and superoxide dismutase activity of head kidney macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, the overexpression and knockdown of TroACP6 in vivo had a significant effect on bacterial infection.

The objective of this narrative review is to examine the most important aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of LAL-D and to provide practical expert recommendations. The infantile-onset form occurs in the first weeks of life and is characterized by malnourishment and failure to thrive due to gastrointestinal impairment (vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption), as well as systemic inflammation, hepatosplenomegaly, and adrenal calcifications. Mortality is close to 100% before one year of life in the absence of specific treatment. The later-onset form can be diagnosed in childhood or adulthood and is characterized by chronic liver injury and/or lipid profile alterations. When LAL-D is suspected, enzyme activity should be determined to confirm the diagnosis, with analysis from a dried blood spot sample being the quickest and most reliable method. In infantile-onset LAL-D, the initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (sebelipase α) and careful nutritional management with a low-lipid diet is very urgent, as prognosis is directly linked to the early initiation of specific treatment. In recent years, our knowledge of the management of LAL-D has increased considerably, with improvements regarding the initial enzyme replacement therapy dose and careful nutritional treatment with a low-lipid diet to decrease lipid deposition and systemic inflammation, leading to better outcomes.

However, the effect of Lut on Cd-induced inhibition of bone growth in laying chickens remains unclear. This study investigates the effects of Lut on Cd-induced inhibition of bone growth in the femur and tibia of laying chickens. A total of sixty 1-day-old green-eggshell yellow feather laying chickens were randomly assigned to four groups after a 5-day of acclimation period: basal diet (Con), cadmium chloride (CdCl2, Cd), Lut, and Lut + Cd. Bone microstructure, serum biomarkers of bone remodeling, the levels of Cd, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and trace metal elements were assessed using the micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and microwave digestion, respectively. Bone remodeling biomarkers, late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and MAPK and mTOR activator 1 (LAMTOR1), as well as the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) and protein kinase B (Akt), were quantified using the qRT-PCR and western blot. The results indicated that Lut effectively mitigated Cd-induced bone mass loss compared to the Cd group, resulting in increased bone volume (BV), bone surface/bone volume (BS/BV), connectivity density (Conn.Dn), and the length and weight of the femur and tibia in laying chickens. Mechanistically, compared to Cd group, Lut restored the ratio of osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in serum and bone tissue, enhanced the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteocalcin (OCN), and Osterix (OSX), while reducing the levels of Ca, Cd, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, as well as the expression of osteopontin (OPN), c-Fos, osteoclast stimulatory-transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9), LAMTOR1, and the phosphorylation of AMPKα and Akt.

Moreover, S. siamea extract (250-1000 mg/kg BW) was tested using normal rats with and without sucrose of 3 g/kg BW administration. The results showed that all extract concentrations significantly reduced fasting blood glucose compared with the control. In addition, results also agreed with the amount of sucrose in the small intestine of rats. In the acute toxicity study, a single dose of the S. siamea extract at 2000 mg/kg BW caused no mortality, and hematological and biochemical parameters also revealed no toxic effects of the extract on rats. The subchronic toxicity study, administration of the extract for 90 days, at 250 mg/kg BW, caused no significant changes in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats in the treated groups compared with the control group. However, histopathology of the liver and kidney indicated an inflammatory response at 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of the extract, correlating to hematological and biochemical findings.

""" 39557851: The RON receptor tyrosine kinase is critical in the pathogenesis of various cancer types, however, its role in bladder cancer invasive growth is still largely unknown. Here, we found that over 90% of bladder cancer samples exhibit elevated levels of RON expression, with significantly higher expression levels observed in invasive bladder cancer compared to non-invasive bladder cancer. In vitro, RON activation resulted in increased bladder cancer cell migration and invasiveness. Results from mRNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that MMP12, a downstream molecule of RON, is functionally involved in regulating RON-mediated bladder cancer cell migration and invasiveness. The underlying mechanism appeared to be the RON-mediated inhibition of HIF-2α ubiquitination, which is channeled through the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Consequently, the activated JNK pathway increased MMP12 expression, ultimately driving bladder cancer cell migration and invasion. As evident in bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter assays, the RON mRNA at its 3'-untranslated regions specifically interacted with hsa-miR-659-3p. The binding of hsa-miR-659-3p downregulated the RON gene expression, attenuating the receptor-mediated tumorigenic activities of bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, aberrant RON expression in bladder cancer cells and MMP12 and HIF-2α activities form a functional axis that causes increased bladder cancer cell migration and invasion. The fact that hsa-miR-659-3p downregulates RON expression indicates its critical role in attenuating RON-mediated tumorigenic effect on bladder cancer cells. These findings highlight the importance of RON targeting as a therapeutic means for potential bladder cancer therapy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39557851/ """,
""" 39849732: Stem-end rot caused by Neofusicoccum parvum is among the most detrimental diseases affecting postharvest mangoes. The present investigation utilized (E)-2-octenal to manage N. parvum infections, elucidating its mechanism of action. The findings revealed that (E)-2-octenal exhibited outstanding antimicrobial potency against N. parvum in vitro within the concentration range of 0.4-1.6 µL/mL. Additionally, (E)-2-octenal significantly compromised the cell membrane integrity and mitochondrial energy metabolism of N. parvum, evidenced by dramatically increased intracellular material leakage and ROS levels, along with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP, and energy charge. Further experiments showed noteworthy effects on the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle and the key enzyme activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Molecular docking revealed hydrogen bonding between (E)-2-octenal's aldehyde group and SDH (Trp-307) and MDH (Gly-101), indicating direct targeting of these enzymes for inhibition. To enhance the practical application of (E)-2-octenal, we developed an aerogel-loaded (E)-2-octenal material (ALO) that exhibited superior antimicrobial efficacy in vitro. In vivo, ALO effectively controlled mango stem-end rot, with optimal efficacy at 20 µL/L. This concentration also delayed the natural disease of mango without degrading fruit quality. According to these findings, (E)-2-octenal is a promising preservative against postharvest mango infections, potentially by impeding cellular energy metabolism through direct interaction with SDH and MDH within the TCA pathway, culminating in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell membrane damage. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39849732/ """,
""" 39950148: Senna siamea (Lam.) H.S. Irwin &amp; Barneby is used in Thai cuisine. This plant is also used in traditional treatments, including diabetes. Therefore, this study aims to examine the antihyperglycemic effects of S. siamea heartwood extract. The ethanolic extract of S. siamea heartwood exhibited activity against α-glucosidase enzyme with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 54.4 μg/mL. Moreover, S. siamea extract (250-1000 mg/kg BW) was tested using normal rats with and without sucrose of 3 g/kg BW administration. The results showed that all extract concentrations significantly reduced fasting blood glucose compared with the control. In addition, results also agreed with the amount of sucrose in the small intestine of rats. In the acute toxicity study, a single dose of the S. siamea extract at 2000 mg/kg BW caused no mortality, and hematological and biochemical parameters also revealed no toxic effects of the extract on rats. The subchronic toxicity study, administration of the extract for 90 days, at 250 mg/kg BW, caused no significant changes in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats in the treated groups compared with the control group. However, histopathology of the liver and kidney indicated an inflammatory response at 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of the extract, correlating to hematological and biochemical findings. Finally, molecular docking was conducted to evaluate theoretical interactions between three main stilbenes previously found in S. siamea extract and mammalian α-glucosidases (Wistar rat and human). The simulation supported the in vivo study and suggested the potential for human glucosidase inhibition. Therefore, S. siamea could be a promising candidate against α-glucosidase. This study offers encouraging information on the potential of natural compounds from S. siamea to act as α-glucosidase inhibitors for diabetes treatment through drug development or dietary supplement for hyperglycemia individuals. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39950148/ """,

""" 39870954: Caffeine consumption is regarded as a widespread phenomenon, and its usage has continued to increase. In addition, the growing usage of antidepressants worldwide and increase in mental health disorders were shown in recent statistical analyses conducted by the World Health Organisation. The coadministration of caffeine and antidepressants remains a concern due to potential interactions that can alter a patient's response to therapy. This review investigates the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between caffeine and the five main classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and other antidepressants not categorised by class, which we have categorised as 'miscellaneous'. The interaction between fluvoxamine and caffeine resulted in increased concentrations of caffeine in the body and lowered the renal clearance of fluvoxamine. Other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and escitalopram had augmented antidepressant effects by decreasing their renal clearance and prolonging their effects in the body when coadministered with caffeine. Caffeine may also increase the concentration of paroxetine, potentially affecting its pharmacodynamic effects. TCAs such as clomipramine, imipramine, desipramine, and sertraline, were found to reduce the metabolism of caffeine. However, studies suggest caffeine had no significant effect on the concentration of these medications in blood or brain tissue. The inhibition of caffeine at high doses when used with MAOIs such as tranylcypromine and phenelzine was found to lead to a higher likelihood of experiencing hypertension. Coadministration of caffeine with venlafaxine (SNRIs) suggests minimal interactions between the two substances and the pharmacodynamic effects of venlafaxine were unlikely to be impacted by caffeine consumption. Miscellaneous antidepressants (reboxetine, mianserin, agomelatine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine) displayed varying pharmacodynamic interactions with caffeine, resulting in increased antidepressant effects where vortioxetine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine failed to demonstrate any interactions. In conclusion, caffeine demonstrated varying effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each class of antidepressants, with several classes of antidepressants demonstrating a similar effect on caffeine. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39870954/ """,
""" 38438772: Machine learning models are increasingly being used to estimate brain age from neuroimaging data. The gap between chronological age and the estimated brain age gap (BAG) is potentially a measure of accelerated and resilient brain aging. Brain age calculated in this fashion has been shown to be associated with mortality, measures of physical function, health, and disease. Here, we estimate the BAG using a voxel-based elastic net regression approach, and then, we investigate its associations with mortality, cognitive status, and measures of health and disease in participants from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study who had a brain MRI at visit 5 of the study. Finally, we used the SOMAscan assay containing 4877 proteins to examine the proteomic associations with the MRI-defined BAG. Among N = 1849 participants (age, 76.4 (SD 5.6)), we found that increased values of BAG were strongly associated with increased mortality and increased severity of the cognitive status. Strong associations with mortality persisted when the analyses were performed in cognitively normal participants. In addition, it was strongly associated with BMI, diabetes, measures of physical function, hypertension, prevalent heart disease, and stroke. Finally, we found 33 proteins associated with BAG after a correction for multiple comparisons. The top proteins with positive associations to brain age were growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), Sushi, von Willebrand factor type A, EGF, and pentraxin domain-containing protein 1 (SEVP 1), matrilysin (MMP7), ADAMTS-like protein 2 (ADAMTS), and heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B (HSPA1B) while EGF-receptor (EGFR), mast/stem-cell-growth-factor-receptor (KIT), coagulation-factor-VII, and cGMP-dependent-protein-kinase-1 (PRKG1) were negatively associated to brain age. Several of these proteins were previously associated with dementia in ARIC. These results suggest that circulating proteins implicated in biological aging, cellular senescence, angiogenesis, and coagulation are associated with a neuroimaging measure of brain aging. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38438772/ """,

""" 39947523: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy (PCH) is a complex condition with an incompletely understood pathogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) may play a significant role in various cellular processes, yet their impact on PCH remains unexplored. In this study, we performed tsRNA sequencing on plasma samples from PCH patients and identified a marked decrease in the expression of tRNA-related fragment 16-R29P4PE (tRF-16-R29P4PE), a specific tsRNA fragment, with a diagnostic area under the curve value of 0.7750. Using Angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated H9c2 cardiomyocytes as an in vitro model and Sprague-Dawley rats as an in vivo model, we investigated the effects of tRF-16-R29P4PE minic/inhibitors and silencing of the paired basic amino acid cleaving system 4 (PACE4) gene. Our results demonstrated that modulating tRF-16-R29P4PE expression significantly reduced brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and free fatty acid levels while enhancing ATP production, glucose levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential. These effects were accompanied by the downregulation of PACE4, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4), and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), as well as the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Animal experiments revealed that tRF-16-R29P4PE minic improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial fibrosis, and mitigated metabolic disorders and mitochondrial damage. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and molecular docking assays confirmed a direct interaction between PACE4 and HIF-1α, and luciferase reporter assays identified PACE4 as a direct target of tRF-16-R29P4PE. By regulating the PACE4 and HIF-1α/PPARα signaling pathways, tRF-16-R29P4PE alleviates PCH, providing a promising molecular target for therapeutic intervention. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39947523/ """,

The immobilization process was optimized applying the Box-Behnken methodology. The immobilized biocatalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda pore size analyses, and elemental analysis. Covalent immobilization proved to be better than adsorption based on the specific activity, immobilization yield, and stability in hospital wastewater (HWW) of the biocatalysts. The biocatalyst prepared using GLA under optimized conditions (laccase loading: 10 kU/L, pH 5, temperature: 5 °C, immobilization time: 8 h, and GLA amount: 100 mM) demonstrated better stability to pH, temperature, and other denaturants, compared to free laccase. It exhibited good catalytic potential to remove phenolic compound acetaminophen (83%) and other trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) such as mefenamic acid (86%), indomethacin (73%), carbamazepine (62%), ibuprofen (43%), naproxen (37%), and ketoprofen (27%), in a mixture from a real non-treated hospital effluent spiked with 1 µg/L of each of the above compounds.

""" 29440352: The non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src participates in bone metabolism by regulating the activities of both the bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. In this study, we investigated whether megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase (Matk), a potent inhibitor of c-Src, affects the functions of murine osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Results revealed that the formation of osteoclasts with actin rings was attenuated by Matk overexpression in osteoclast precursor cells but was enhanced by Matk knockdown. The inhibitory effect of Matk on osteoclasts was closely related with the inhibition of c-Src activity. Intriguingly, Matk overexpression in osteoblasts reduced bone nodule formation. Conversely, Matk knockdown increased osteoblast function. Most importantly, binding of Matk to Runx2 resulted in the inhibition of Runx2 translocation into the nucleus and downregulation of Runx2 target genes. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that Matk plays a critical role in bone metabolism by impairing the functions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts via distinct mechanisms involving inhibition of c-Src-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440352/ """,
""" 39943212: The self-administration of meloxicam via medicated feed is a novel concept that could enable non-invasive, pre-emptive and long-term analgesia. Forty Bos taurus male calves were randomly allocated to four treatment groups: no castration (PC), surgical castration (NC), surgical castration with subcutaneous meloxicam (M), and surgical castration with medicated lick blocks (ML). Data collection occurred at various timepoints over 13 days following treatment. Plasma concentration of meloxicam was greater in ML compared to M calves at all timepoints except day 1 (p &lt; 0.001); however, variation between ML individuals was high (standard deviation = 1.68). There was no effect of treatment on scrotal diameter or scrotal temperature. Wound morphology scores were improved in ML compared to NC calves. Eating observations were greater in ML calves immediately post-castration, followed by M calves at 3 h post-castration (p &lt; 0.001). ML calves were observed locomoting more (p = 0.0032) and lying less (p &lt; 0.001) than PC calves.

""" 38113075: Kinase inhibitors are crucial in cancer treatment, but drug resistance and side effects hinder the development of effective drugs. To address these challenges, it is essential to analyze the polypharmacology of kinase inhibitor and identify compound with high selectivity profile. This study presents KinomeMETA, a framework for profiling the activity of small molecule kinase inhibitors across a panel of 661 kinases. By training a meta-learner based on a graph neural network and fine-tuning it to create kinase-specific learners, KinomeMETA outperforms benchmark multi-task models and other kinase profiling models. It provides higher accuracy for understudied kinases with limited known data and broader coverage of kinase types, including important mutant kinases. Case studies on the discovery of new scaffold inhibitors for membrane-associated tyrosine- and threonine-specific cdc2-inhibitory kinase and selective inhibitors for fibroblast growth factor receptors demonstrate the role of KinomeMETA in virtual screening and kinome-wide activity profiling.

Rifaximin, an oral, broad-spectrum antibiotic has been shown to have efficacy for some patients. In the present study CB0125, a novel Rifamycin SV in situ gelling formulation, was developed as a potential pouchitis therapy. This mixture undergoes sol to gel transition under physiological pH and temperature upon administration to the target organ by enema. The in vivo efficacy of the in situ gel was performed using dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis model in C57/Bl6 mice. The clinical parameters such as body weight changes, rectal bleeding and stool consistency were compared to mesalamine (positive control). In addition, a histopathological investigation was conducted to assess severity of mucosal damage and inflammation infiltrate. CB0125 was well tolerated and there was a significant reduction in disease activity, improved colon weight to length ratio, and improved histology score for the CB-01-25 in situ gel group compared to placebo gel. In addition, CB0125 was superior to mesalamine and to rifamycin SV dissolved in water.
