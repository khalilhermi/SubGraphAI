""" 34887573: Intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture leads to subarachnoid hemorrhage, a sudden-onset disease that often causes death or severe disability. Although genome-wide association studies have identified common genetic variants that increase IA risk moderately, the contribution of variants with large effect remains poorly defined. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified significant enrichment of rare, deleterious mutations in PPIL4, encoding peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 4, in both familial and index IA cases. Ppil4 depletion in vertebrate models causes intracerebral hemorrhage, defects in cerebrovascular morphology and impaired Wnt signaling. Wild-type, but not IA-mutant, PPIL4 potentiates Wnt signaling by binding JMJD6, a known angiogenesis regulator and Wnt activator. These findings identify a novel PPIL4-dependent Wnt signaling mechanism involved in brain-specific angiogenesis and maintenance of cerebrovascular integrity and implicate PPIL4 gene mutations in the pathogenesis of IA. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887573/ """,

""" 39943810: Around one-third of adults in Algeria have hypertension, but > 40% are unaware they have the disease, and of those receiving treatment, only ~ 20-30% have adequate blood pressure (BP) control. Recommended starting treatment is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or diuretic. A single-pill combination of perindopril/amlodipine (ACEi/CCB) recently became available in Algeria. Twelve Algerian hypertension experts reviewed the clinical evidence regarding this therapeutic combination to determine its potential role for hypertension management in Algeria. The evidence indicated that this combination reduces cardiovascular outcomes and visit-to-visit BP variability, effectively controls 24-hour BP, and is well tolerated. In conclusion, the perindopril/amlodipine SPC provides a valuable new treatment option for hypertension in Algeria. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39943810/ """,

After C-33A cells were transfected with pcDNA-NFAT5 or NFAT5-short hairpin RNA (shRNA), cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK-8 and EdU assays, transwell assays, and flow cytometry, respectively. Biomarkers indicating mitochondrial function, including the expression of the d-loop, ATP levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential, were detected. NFAT5 knockdown restrained cell proliferation and invasion, impaired mitochondrial function, and increased the ratio of cell apoptosis; however, NFAT5 overexpression showed the opposite results.

""" 39942052: Dietary interventions with food-derived natural products have emerged as a promising strategy to alleviate obesity. This study aims to investigate the anti-obesity effect of Hericium erinaceus protein (HEP) and its underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that HEP exhibited excellent radical scavenging activity in vitro. In vivo, HEP intervention reduced pancreatic lipase activity in the intestine and enhanced fat excretion, thereby inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats. Meanwhile, HEP ameliorated the body weight and organ indexes, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and liver oxidative stress injuries in obese mice. The results of real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses indicated that HEP upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), subsequently upregulated the expression of liver fatty acid oxidation-related genes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT-1a), and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1)) and downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1), and fatty acid synthase (FASN)), thereby ameliorating lipid metabolism disorders.

""" 39076376: Introduction: Carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CROT) is a well-established peroxisomal enzyme involved in liver fatty acid oxidation, but less is known about its recently discovered role in promoting vascular calcification, and whether CROT-dependent liver metabolism contributes to the latter. To date, CROT function in the context of calcification potential has been conducted in the dyslipidemic low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice. Objectives: To differentiate peroxisome and CROT-dependent lipid biology from that of lipoprotein-mediated lipid biology, we therefore conducted a metabolomic analysis of the liver and plasma of normolipidemic CROT-deficient (Crot-/-) mice. Methods: We performed LC-MS-based metabolomics on liver and plasma derived from Crot-/- and Crot +/- mice and sibling Crot+/+ mice, using a dual-phase metabolite extraction protocol, and multiple LC-MS acquisition strategies. Results: We identified between 79 to 453 annotated metabolites from annotated metabolites from liver samples, and 117 to 424 annotated metabolites from plasma samples. Through differential abundance analysis, we determined that omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA, DPA, and DHA were higher in the liver of Crot-/- and Crot +/- mice than Crot+/+ mice. EPA were higher in plasma of Crot-/- mice than Crot+/+ mice. We also determined that the anti-inflammatory dicarboxylic acids, tetradecanedioic acid and azelaic acid, were higher in the plasma of CROT-deficient mice. Conclusion: Our study associated genetic CROT deletion with increased levels of anti-inflammatory molecules in mouse liver and plasma. These results suggest a potential mechanism for anti-calcification effects of CROT suppression and the potential use of omega-3 fatty acids as biomarkers for future CROT inhibition therapies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39076376/ """,
""" 39474586: Milk fat globules (MFGs) are a remarkable example of nature's ingenuity. Human milk (HM) carries contains 3-5% fat, 0.8-0.9% protein, 6.9-7.2% carbohydrate calculated as lactose, and 0.2% mineral constituents. Most of these nutrients are carried in these MFGs, which are composed of an energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) core surrounded by a triple membrane structure. The membrane contains polar lipids, specialized proteins, glycoproteins, and cholesterol. Each of these bioactive components serves important nutritional, immunological, neurological, and digestive functions. These MFGs are designed to release energy rapidly in the upper gastrointestinal tract and then persist for some time in the gut lumen so that the protective bioactive molecules are conveyed to the colon. These properties may shape the microbial colonization and innate immune properties of the developing gastrointestinal tract. Milk fat globules in milk from humans and ruminants may resemble in structure but there are considerable differences in size, profile, composition, and specific constituents. There are possibilities to not only enhance the nutritional composition in a goal-oriented fashion to correct specific deficiencies in the infant but also to use these fat globules as a nutraceutical in infants who require specific treatments. To mention a few, there might be possibilities in enhancing neurodevelopment, in defense against gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections, improving insulin sensitivity, treating chronic inflammation, and altering plasma lipids. This review provides an overview of the composition, structure, and biological activities of the various components of the MFGs.

However, few rapid tests are available to monitor the banned phenacetin. Though one phenacetin immunoassay has been reported already, its unmet selectivity limits the wider application in rapid screening. Herein, a highly specific and sensitive phenacetin antibody was induced by long spacer arms-based immunogens coupling with low-electronegativity coating antigen. Furthermore, a precise indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) and a field practical colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (AuNPs-LFIA) were developed for phenacetin detection in Guangdong herbal teas. This work exhibits low detection limits (8.80 ng/mL for ic-ELISA, 2.19 ng/mL for AuNPs-LFIA) and reasonable recoveries (102.8%-111.1% and 91.68%-111.91%). It is noteworthy that both of the developed ic-ELISA and AuNPs-LFIA have high accuracy and practicability in blind herbal tea analysis, which was validated by the authorized liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry method.

""" 39870954: Caffeine consumption is regarded as a widespread phenomenon, and its usage has continued to increase. In addition, the growing usage of antidepressants worldwide and increase in mental health disorders were shown in recent statistical analyses conducted by the World Health Organisation. The coadministration of caffeine and antidepressants remains a concern due to potential interactions that can alter a patient's response to therapy. This review investigates the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between caffeine and the five main classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and other antidepressants not categorised by class, which we have categorised as 'miscellaneous'. The interaction between fluvoxamine and caffeine resulted in increased concentrations of caffeine in the body and lowered the renal clearance of fluvoxamine. Other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and escitalopram had augmented antidepressant effects by decreasing their renal clearance and prolonging their effects in the body when coadministered with caffeine. Caffeine may also increase the concentration of paroxetine, potentially affecting its pharmacodynamic effects. TCAs such as clomipramine, imipramine, desipramine, and sertraline, were found to reduce the metabolism of caffeine. However, studies suggest caffeine had no significant effect on the concentration of these medications in blood or brain tissue. The inhibition of caffeine at high doses when used with MAOIs such as tranylcypromine and phenelzine was found to lead to a higher likelihood of experiencing hypertension. Coadministration of caffeine with venlafaxine (SNRIs) suggests minimal interactions between the two substances and the pharmacodynamic effects of venlafaxine were unlikely to be impacted by caffeine consumption. Miscellaneous antidepressants (reboxetine, mianserin, agomelatine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine) displayed varying pharmacodynamic interactions with caffeine, resulting in increased antidepressant effects where vortioxetine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine failed to demonstrate any interactions. In conclusion, caffeine demonstrated varying effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each class of antidepressants, with several classes of antidepressants demonstrating a similar effect on caffeine. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39870954/ """,

""" 39956791: The cell cycle is predominantly controlled by Cyclins/Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (Cyc/CDK) complexes, which phosphorylate targets involved in cellular proliferation. Evidence suggests that Cyc/CDK targets extend beyond traditional proteins and include enzymes that regulate the central carbon metabolism. Maize embryo axes rapidly internalize and metabolize glucose. After 24 h of imbibition in glucose-rich media, axes exhibited increased length and weight, with more pronounced effects at 72 h. This morphology enhancement was impaired when RO-3306, a specific CDK inhibitor, was added. The protein profile of maize embryo extracts at 18 and 24 h indicated altered phosphorylation patterns following CDK activity inhibition. Metabolomic analysis at 24 h of imbibition revealed that maize embryos without sugar in the media, with or without RO-3306, had a decreased sugar and amino acid content. Conversely, axes exposed to glucose demonstrated increased conversion into various mono and di-saccharides such as fructose, mannitol, galactose, and maltose but not sucrose. This pattern was reversed upon the addition of RO-3306. Glucose promoted the accumulation of amino acids such as cysteine, valine, leucine, and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, such as malate and citrate. The CDK inhibitor redirected the glucose metabolism toward increased serine levels, followed by other amino acids like phenylalanine, valine, and leucine. Additionally, TCA cycle intermediates and sterols significantly decreased. Overall, these results contribute to understanding the role of CDK in maize morphogenesis during germination and underscore its impact on modulating various central carbon pathways, including glycolysis, amino acid catabolism/anabolism, TCA cycle, and sterols biosynthesis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956791/ """,

""" 39942906: Nitric oxide (NO) breaks a seed's dormancy and stimulates germination by signaling. However, the key physiological metabolic pathways and molecular regulatory mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, this study used physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomics methods to analyze the key genes and metabolites involved in the NO regulation of plant embryo germination and their potential regulatory mechanisms. The physiological analysis results indicate that the appropriate concentration of NO increased the content of NO and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in cells, stimulated the synthesis of ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA), induced a decrease in abscisic acid (ABA) content, antagonistic to the gibberellin (GA<sub>3</sub>) effect, and promoted embryo germination and subsequent seedling growth. However, the high concentrations of NO caused excessive accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, destroyed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, and inhibited embryo germination and seedling growth. The combined analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics showed that the genes related to phenylpropanoid (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase, ferulate-5-hydroxylase, coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase), and flavonoid synthesis (10 genes such as CHS) were significantly up-regulated during embryo germination. The high concentration of exogenous NO inhibited embryo germination by up-regulating the expression of 4-coumaric acid coenzyme A ligase (4CL) and negatively regulating the expression of flavonoid synthesis genes. This suggests that NO concentration-dependently regulates phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, thereby affecting ROS metabolism and hormone levels, and ultimately regulates the dormancy and germination of Sorbus pohuashanensis embryos. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39942906/ """,

""" 35175663: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling plays a key role in neuroinflammation. Here we show that IGF-1 also regulates phagocytosis of reactive astrocytes through p110α isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), differentially in both sexes. Systemic bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treatment increased the expression of GFAP, a reactive astrocyte marker, in the cortex of mice in both sexes and was blocked by IGF-1 only in males. In primary astrocytes, LPS enhanced the mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR2,4) and proinflammatory factors: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), chemokine interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) in male and female. Treatment with IGF-1 counteracted TLR4 but not TLR2, iNOS, and IP10 expression in both sexes and cytokines expression in males. Furthermore, reactive astrocyte phagocytosis was modulated by IGF-1 only in male astrocytes. IGF-1 was also able to increase AKT-phosphorylation only in male astrocytes. PI3K inhibitors, AG66, TGX-221, and CAL-101, with selectivity toward catalytic p110α, p110β, and p110δ isoforms respectively, reduced AKT-phosphorylation in males. All isoforms interact physically with IGF-1-receptor in both sexes. However, the expression of p110α is higher in males while the expression of IGF-1-receptor is similar in male and female. AG66 suppressed the IGF-1 effect on cytokine expression and counteracted the IGF-1-produced phagocytosis decrease in male reactive astrocytes. Results suggest that sex-differences in the effect of IGF-1 on the AKT-phosphorylation could be due to a lower expression of the p110α in female and that IGF-1-effects on the inflammatory response and phagocytosis of male reactive astrocytes are mediated by p110α/PI3K subunit. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35175663/ """,
""" 39532277: Chronic stress significantly impacts both physical and mental wellbeing, increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, immune dysregulation, and psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. The plasma proteome is a valuable source of biomarkers of health and disease, but the limited number of studies exploring the potential of the plasma proteome as a biomarker for stress-related disorders underscores the importance of further investigation of the effects of chronic stress on the plasma proteome. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a 5-week chronic psychosocial stress paradigm on the plasma proteome in mice and to determine if any affected proteins correlated with stress-induced changes in behaviour and physiology, and thus might represent biomarkers of negative impacts of chronic stress. Using LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis, 38 proteins in the mouse plasma proteome were identified to be affected by chronic psychosocial stress. Functional analysis revealed that these proteins clustered into biological functions including inflammatory response, regulation of the immune response, complement and coagulation cascades, lipid metabolic process, and high-density lipoprotein particles. Correlation analyses of the identified proteins with stress-induced behavioral or physiological changes stress revealed significant correlations between stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour and Phosphatidylinositol-glycan-specific phospholipase D, Complement C2, Epidermal growth factor receptor, Prosaposin, Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1B, Maltase-glucoamylase, Mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase IA and Fibrinogen-like protein 1. Chronic psychosocial stress blunted acute stress-induced corticosterone release, and this correlated with abundance of Pyrethroid hydrolase Ces2a; N-fatty-acyl-amino acid synthase/hydrolase Pm20d1, Mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase IA, Alpha-2-macroglobulin-P and L-selectin.

Upon snakebite envenomation, svPLA<sub>2</sub>s hydrolyze cell membrane phospholipids and induce pathological effects such as paralysis, myonecrosis, inflammation, or pain. Despite its central importance in envenomation, the chemical mechanism of svPLA<sub>2</sub>s is poorly understood, with detrimental consequences for the design of small-molecule snakebite antidotes, which is highly undesirable given the gravity of the epidemiological data that ranks snakebite as the deadliest neglected tropical disease. We study a member of the svPLA<sub>2</sub> family, the Myotoxin-I, which is part of the venom of the Central American pit viper terciopelo (Bothrops asper), a ubiquitous but highly aggressive and dangerous species responsible for the most problematic snakebites in its habitat. Furthermore, PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes are a paradigm of interfacial enzymology, as the complex membrane-enzyme interaction is as important as is crucial for its catalytic process. Here, we explore the detailed interaction between svPLA<sub>2</sub> and a 1 : 1 POPC/POPS membrane, and how enzyme binding affects membrane structure and dynamics. We further investigated the two most widely accepted reaction mechanisms for svPLA<sub>2</sub>s: the 'single-water mechanism' and the 'assisted-water mechanism', using umbrella sampling simulations at the PBE/MM level of theory. We demonstrate that both pathways are catalytically viable. While both pathways occur in two steps, the single-water mechanism yielded a lower activation free energy barrier (20.14 kcal mol-1) for POPC hydrolysis, consistent with experimental and computational values obtained for human PLA<sub>2</sub>. The reaction mechanisms are similar, albeit not identical, and can be generalized to svPLA<sub>2</sub> from most viper species. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the sole small molecule inhibitor currently undergoing clinical trials for snakebite is a perfect transition state analog. Thus, understanding snake venom sPLA<sub>2</sub> chemistry will help find new, effective small molecule inhibitors with anti-snake venom efficacy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39759936/ """,

Primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is an autoimmune disease in which antigens-mainly the phospholipase A2 receptor-are located in the podocytes and are targeted by circulating antibodies, leading to in situ formation of immune complexes that activate the complement system. Clinically, the disease is characterized by nephrotic syndrome (NS) and associated complications. The outcome of PMN can vary, but untreated patients with NS may progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in 35-40% of cases within 10 years. Treatment primarily aims to prevent NS complications and progression to ESKD. The most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs are rituximab, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and calcineurin inhibitors. Most patients may experience an improvement of proteinuria, which can sometimes be followed by NS relapse. Fewer than 50% of patients with PMN achieve complete and stable remission.

""" 39928310: Decidualization, the transformation of human endometrial stromal cells from a fibroblast-like to a rounded morphology, is crucial for creating a receptive intrauterine environment that supports successful embryo implantation. While decidual markers such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 and prolactin are well studied, the specific signaling mechanisms underlying morphological changes during decidualization remain unclear. In this study, we identified the phosphatidic acid (PA)-Src-focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway as a critical regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangement during PA-induced decidualization in human endometrial stromal cells. PA, a product of phospholipase D1, activates FAK, initiating a cascade of events involving Src-family kinases and RhoA signaling, ultimately leading to the cytoskeletal changes necessary for decidualization. Our in vitro experiments showed that PA-induced decidualization involved the formation of stress fibers mediated by ROCK activation. The traditional decidual markers, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 and prolactin, did not significantly influence these morphological changes, suggesting that the PA-induced pathway operates independently of these markers. In vivo studies in ovariectomized mice demonstrated that PA injection into the uterine horn increased the uterine cavity weight and wall thickness, reinforcing the role of PA in promoting decidualization. These findings highlight the importance of the PA-Src-FAK-RhoA-ROCK pathway in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics during decidualization and suggest potential therapeutic targets for addressing implantation-associated infertility. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39928310/ """,
""" 39939306: In multicellular systems, the migration pattern of individual cells critically relies on the interactions with neighboring cells. Depending on the strength of these interactions, cells either move as a collective, as observed during morphogenesis and wound healing, or migrate individually, as it is the case for immune cells and fibroblasts. Mediators of cell-cell adhesions, such as cadherins coordinate collective dynamics by linking the cytoskeleton of neighboring cells. However, whether intercellular binding alone triggers signals that originate from within the plasma membrane itself, remains unclear. Here, we address this question through artificial photoswitchable cell-cell adhesions that selectively connect adjacent plasma membranes without linking directly to cytoskeletal elements. We find that these intercellular adhesions are sufficient to achieve collective cell migration. Linking adjacent cells increases membrane tension, which activates the enzyme phospholipase D2. The resulting increase in phosphatidic acid, in turn, stimulates the mammalian target of rapamycin, a known actuator of collective cell migration. Collectively, these findings introduce a membrane-based signaling axis as promotor of collective cell dynamics, which is independent of the direct coupling of cell-cell adhesions to the cytoskeleton. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39939306/ """,

""" 39948566: Serine metabolism provides important metabolic intermediates that support the rapid proliferation of tumor cells. However, the role of serine metabolism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that serine starvation predominantly inhibits ESCC cell proliferation by suppressing purine nucleotides and NADPH synthesis. Mechanistically, serine depletion led to the accumulation of aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), an intermediate metabolite of de novo purine synthesis, and AMP/ATP ratio. These increases activated 5'-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which subsequently inhibited the mTORC1 pathway by phosphorylating Raptor at Ser792. Moreover, serine depletion decreased NADPH level followed by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage, which induced p53-p21 mediated G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Conversely, serine starvation activated transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-mediated robust expression of phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) which in turn promoted compensatory endogenous serine synthesis, thus maintaining ESCC cell survival under serine-limited conditions. Accordingly, serine deprivation combined with PSAT1 inhibition significantly suppressed ESCC tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that serine starvation suppresses the proliferation of ESCC cells by disturbing the synthesis of purine nucleotides and NADPH, and the combination of serine deprivation and PSAT1 inhibition significantly impairs ESCC tumor growth. Our study provides a theoretical basis for targeting serine metabolism as a potential therapeutic strategy for ESCC. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39948566/ """,

Despite its prevalence, leishmaniasis continues to be a neglected disease, mainly affecting underdeveloped countries. In Brazil, the available treatments are pentavalent antimonials and amphotericin B, which are outdated, toxic, require prolonged parenteral administration and have limited efficacy. The heterocyclic ring oxadiazole has been documented in the literature to possess various biological activities, including leishmanicidal properties, thus positioning it as a potential candidate for further investigation. This study aims to evaluate the in vitro leishmanicidal activity of an oxadiazole compound (2i), explore its mechanism of action through enzymatic inhibition and molecular docking, assess its antioxidant activity, and conduct an in silico pharmacokinetic prediction. Pharmacokinetic predictions via ADME/TOX modeling revealed that the 2i molecule exhibits good intestinal absorption (92 %), is water-insoluble (-4 log.mol/L) and demonstrates high permeability in Caco-2 cells (1.35 log.Papp10-6cm/s), suggesting potential for oral administration. Metabolic studies indicated that oxadiazole 2i is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, necessitating further evaluation of potential drug interactions. Additionally, it did not exhibit hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity; however, it demonstrated mutagenic potential in the salmonella reverse mutation test (AMES), which is a genetic method that detects mutagenic chemical agents, thus justifying more complex confirmatory studies. In vitro assays showed that oxadiazole 2i has DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical reducing activity, indicating potential antioxidant properties with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 12.10 µg/mL. Concerning its leishmanicidal mechanism of action, molecular docking simulations at the active site of acetylcholinesterase demonstrated that the 2i molecule had superior binding energy values compared to the reference drug physostigmine (-7.39 kcal/mol versus -6.66 kcal/mol, respectively). However, the pharmacophore map revealed that physostigmine had more molecular interactions than oxadiazole 2i. In acetylcholinesterase inhibition assays, the 2i molecule exhibited significant inhibitory activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 11.91 µg/mL, suggesting a mechanism of action that compromises the parasitic membrane. Moreover, the 2i molecule demonstrated significant leishmanicidal activity against L. infantum with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 30.86 μM.

Upon reaching the tumor tissue, protease-facilitated depegylation of pegylated zinc protoporphyrin with ester bonds between PEG and ZnPP (esPEG-ZnPP) occurs, leading to a faster cellular uptake and superior antitumor efficacy compared to PEG-ZnPP with ether bonds (etPEG-ZnPP). This finding provides a viable strategy for achieving efficient tumor-specific drug release by utilizing an ester linkage between PEG and antitumor drugs. Another strategy involves using styrene-maleic acid copolymer (SMA), an amphiphilic polymer. Drug-encapsulating SMA aggregates disintegrate upon interaction with cell membrane components, releasing the encapsulated active drug. The author has demonstrated an improvement in the tumor accumulation of SMA-based macromolecular drugs by conjugating pirarubicin (THP), an anthracycline antitumor drug, with SMA. Furthermore, by conjugating various molecular weights of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) to THP via a hydrazone bond (P-THP, DP-THP, and SP-THP), the author has established a positive correlation between HPMA molecular weight and therapeutic efficacy as well as toxicity. Notably, P-THPs release THP under acidic conditions within tumor tissue; however, this release occurs solely outside tumor cells due to HPMA-mediated inhibition of cellular uptake.

""" 39896282: This study investigates the host response to fucoidan alginate microbeads in comparison to sulfated alginate microbeads, which are relevant for immune protection in cell therapy. While sulfated alginate microbeads reduce fibrosis and inflammation, fucoidan, a kelp-derived polysaccharide rich in sulfate groups, has not been evaluated in this context. The study assesses surface reactivity to acute-phase proteins and cytokines using ex vivo human whole blood and plasma models. It also examines pericapsular overgrowth (PFO) in C57BL/6JRj mice, incorporating protein pattern mapping through LC-MS/MS proteomics. Fucoidan alginate microbeads activated complement and coagulation, while both fucoidan and sulfated alginate microbeads induced plasmin activity. Fucoidan alginate microbeads exhibited a distinct cytokine profile, characterized by high levels of MCP-1, IL-8, IFN-γ, and reduced levels of RANTES, Eotaxin, PDGF-BB, TGF-β isoforms, along with higher PFO. The balance between plasmin activity and coagulation emerged as a potential predictor of fibrosis resistance, favouring sulfated alginate microbeads. Explanted materials were enriched with both complement and coagulation activators (Complement C1q and C3, Factor 12, Kallikrein, HMW-kininogen) and inhibitors (C1-inhibitor, Factor H, Factor I). Fucoidan alginate microbeads predominantly enriched extracellular matrix factors (Fibrinogen, Collagen, TGF-β, Bmp), while sulfated alginate microbeads favoured ECM-degrading proteases (Metalloproteases and Cathepsins). This study reveals significant differences in host responses to fucoidan and sulfated alginate in microbeads. The plasmin activity to coagulation ratio is highlighted as a key indicator of fibrosis resistance. Additionally, the preferential enrichment of ECM-degrading proteases on the material surface post-implantation proved to be another crucial factor. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39896282/ """,
""" 39956697: The biological functions and role in human diseases of lipoprotein (a) discovered more than 60 years ago are still not fully understood. The high homology of apo(a) with plasminogen initially leads us to think of Lp(a) as a player in the coagulation system as pro-thrombotic factor. Over the years, a solid body of evidence from biology, epidemiology and from genetics and mendelian randomization has contributed to identify Lp(a) as a causal factor of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease, aortic calcific valve stenosis and ischaemic stroke. The active involvement of Lp(a) in atherogenesis and aortic calcific valve stenosis has been demonstrated by experimental data regarding the role of oxidized phospholipids, which are the cargo of Lp(a) and the presence of a Lp(a) receptor in valve interstitial cells. In secondary prevention, patients optimally treated for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but with high Lp(a) levels show a residual cardiovascular risk. To date the LDL-C affecting drugs have a marginal effect on Lp(a). Statins produce a modest increase, monoclonal PCSK9i and Inclisiran a modest decrease not sufficient to reduce significantly the risk associated to Lp(a). Only lipoprotein apheresis and obicetrapib, a CETP novel inhibitor, reduce respectively by 75% and 40% Lp(a) levels. To obtain a lifetime risk reduction of 50% similar to that achieved by reducing LDL-C of about 40 mg/dl, Lp(a) should be reduced of about 100 mg/dl.

Moreover, miR-212-5p mimic treatment attenuated and miR-212-5p inhibitor treatment increased VSMC proliferation and migration. Additionally, miR-212-5p mimic treatment suppressed VSMC contraction and related gene expression [Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and Rho-associated protein kinase 2], while miR-212-5p inhibitor treatment exerted opposite effects. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1B2 (PAFAH1B2) is a target of miR-212-5p. miR-212-5p mimic treatment significantly reduced and miR-212-5p inhibitor treatment increased PAFAH1B2 expression. Furthermore, PAFAH1B2 expression was decreased in angiotensin II-treated aortic tissues and VSMCs. PAFAH1B2 was ubiquitously expressed in most adult rat tissues. In the vasculature, PAFAH1B2 was only distributed in the cytoplasm. PAFAH1B2 overexpression decreased A10 cell proliferation, while PAFAH1B2 knockdown increased A10 cell proliferation and cyclin D1 mRNA levels. PAFAH1B2 knockdown stimulated VSMC contraction and RhoA expression.

Dysregulated zinc levels, due to either excess intake or deficiency, are associated with a spectrum of health disorders. In this context, understanding zinc-regulated biological processes at the molecular level holds significant relevance to public health and clinical practice. Identifying and characterizing zinc-regulated proteins in their diverse proteoforms, however, remain a difficult task in advancing zinc biology. Herein, we address this challenge by developing a quantitative chemical proteomics platform that globally profiles the reactivities of proteinaceous cysteines upon cellular zinc depletion. Exploiting a protein-conjugated resin for the selective removal of Zn2+ from culture media, we identify an array of zinc-sensitive cysteines on proteins with diverse functions based on their increased reactivity upon zinc depletion. Notably, we find that zinc regulates the enzymatic activities, post-translational modifications, and subcellular distributions of selected target proteins such as peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase IB subunit alpha1 (PAFAH1B3), and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38484110/ """,
""" 37940657: Cytoplasmic dynein drives the motility and force generation functions towards the microtubule minus end. The assembly of dynein with dynactin and a cargo adaptor in an active transport complex is facilitated by Lis1 and Nde1/Ndel1. Recent studies proposed that Lis1 relieves dynein from its autoinhibited conformation, but the physiological function of Nde1/Ndel1 remains elusive. Here, we investigate how human Nde1 and Lis1 regulate the assembly and subsequent motility of mammalian dynein using in vitro reconstitution and single molecule imaging. We find that Nde1 recruits Lis1 to autoinhibited dynein and promotes Lis1-mediated assembly of dynein-dynactin adaptor complexes. Nde1 can compete with the α2 subunit of platelet activator factor acetylhydrolase 1B (PAF-AH1B) for the binding of Lis1, which suggests that Nde1 may disrupt PAF-AH1B recruitment of Lis1 as a noncatalytic subunit, thus promoting Lis1 binding to dynein. Before the initiation of motility, the association of dynactin with dynein triggers the dissociation of Nde1 from dynein by competing against Nde1 binding to the dynein intermediate chain. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how Nde1 and Lis1 synergistically activate the dynein transport machinery. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37940657/ """,

""" 39815992: Aims: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent hepatic disorder worldwide. Arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), an enzyme catalyzing the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, plays a crucial role in various diseases. Here, we sought to investigate the involvement of ALOX15 in MASLD. Results: In this study, we observed upregulation of ALOX15 in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)- and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mice. Metabolomic analysis revealed elevated levels of ALOX15 metabolites, 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the increased fatty acid uptake regulated by the PPARγ/CD36 pathway predominated in lipid accumulation. To elucidate the mechanism underlying ALOX15-induced lipid accumulation, HepG2 cells were transfected with a lentivirus expressing ALOX15 or small interfering RNA targeting ALOX15 and exposed to palmitic acid (PA). Both ALOX15 overexpression and PA exposure led to increased intracellular free fatty acid and triglyceride, resulting in lipotoxicity. ALOX15 overexpression aggravated the effect of PA, while the knockdown of ALOX15 attenuated PA-induced lipotoxicity. Moreover, the treatment with PPARγ antagonist GW9662 or CD36 inhibitor sulfosuccinimidyl oleate sodium effectively reduced lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity resulting from ALOX15 overexpression and PA exposure, indicating the involvement of the PPARγ/CD36 pathway in ALOX15-mediated lipid accumulation. Furthermore, liraglutide, a widely used glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist (GLP-1RA), improved hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD/STZ-induced mice by suppressing the ALOX15/PPARγ/CD36 pathway.

RNAscope and immunohistochemistry revealed increased ALOX15B expression in lesional psoriasis samples. Using a cytokine cocktail containing IL-17A, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha to produce a psoriasis-like phenotype, a role for ALOX15B in human epidermal keratinocyte inflammation was investigated. siRNA-mediated silencing of ALOX15B increased CCL2 expression and secretion. In addition to CCL2, secretion of CCL5 and CXCL10 were elevated in skin equivalents treated with lipoxygenase inhibitor ML351. Inhibition of the JAK1/STAT1 pathway reversed the enhanced CCL2 expression found with ALOX15B silencing. Previous studies have linked epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition with the upregulation of cytokines including CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10. ALOX15B silencing reduced EGFR expression and inhibition of EGFR signalling potentiated the effect of ALOX15B silencing on increased CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10 expression. Confirming previous findings, gene expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes was reduced via reduced ERK phosphorylation. Reduced ERK phosphorylation was dependant on EGFR and NRF2 activation.

Dysregulation of PLOD3 has been implicated in various malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC).This study aimed to elucidate the role of PLOD3 in CRC and evaluate its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. We conducted a comprehensive analysis utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to evaluate PLOD3 expression in CRC. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to investigate its impact on overall survival. Functional assays, including wound healing, Transwell migration, and invasion assays, were carried out in CRC cell lines with modified PLOD3 expression to elucidate its role in regulating tumor cell behavior. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was employed to identify signaling pathways associated with PLOD3 expression. Our findings demonstrate that PLOD3 is significantly overexpressed in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, and its elevated expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival. The study also developed a RiskScore model incorporating PLOD3 and 11 other genes, which exhibited strong predictive performance for patient outcomes. Functional experiments confirmed that PLOD3 overexpression enhances CRC cell migration and invasion.

This is reflected in the different platelet Ca2+ responses induced by the GPVI agonist collagen-related peptide (CRP) and the PAR1/4 agonist thrombin. Using a 96 well-plate assay with human Calcium-6-loaded platelets and a panel of 22 pharmacological inhibitors, we assessed the cytosolic Ca2+ signaling domains of these receptors and developed an automated Ca2+ curve algorithm. The algorithm was used to evaluate an ultra-high throughput (UHT) based screening of 16,635 chemically diverse small molecules with orally active physicochemical properties for effects on platelets stimulated with CRP or thrombin. Stringent agonist-specific selection criteria resulted in the identification of 151 drug-like molecules, of which three hit compounds were further characterized. The dibenzyl formamide derivative ANO61 selectively modulated thrombin-induced Ca2+ responses, whereas the aromatic sulfonyl imidazole AF299 and the phenothiazine ethopropazine affected CRP-induced responses. Platelet functional assays confirmed selectivity of these hits. Ethopropazine retained its inhibitory potential in the presence of plasma, and suppressed collagen-dependent thrombus buildup at arterial shear rate.

Cd stress significantly reduced plant growth, biomass yield, leaf pigments, and biochemical properties. Conversely, SNP, MT, and particularly their combined (SNP + MT) application reduced Cd toxicity and enhanced growth and physio-biochemical traits of eggplants. For instance, at 50 mg Cd kg-1 soil, SNP, MT, and SNP + MT increased root biomass (41.6, 30, and 47%), total chlorophyll (30.7, 26.3, and 46%), soluble protein (20.5, 17.6 and 37%) and RLWC (23, 17.5, and 29%) over their respective control. Furthermore, SNP + MT significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced levels of EL, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, proline, and MDA by 54.5, 66, 61 and 70%, respectively, in Cd-stressed eggplants.

""" 39870289: The mitochondrial flavoenzymes proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and hydroxyproline dehydrogenase (PRODH2) catalyze the first steps of proline and hydroxyproline catabolism, respectively. The enzymes are targets for chemical probe development because of their roles in cancer cell metabolism (PRODH) and primary hyperoxaluria (PRODH2). Mechanism-based inactivators of PRODH target the FAD by covalently modifying the N5 atom, with N-propargylglycine (NPPG) being the current best-in-class of this type of probe. Here we investigated a close analog of NPPG, but-3-yn-2-ylglycine (B32G), distinguished by having a methyl group adjacent to the ethynyl group of the propargyl warhead. UV-visible spectroscopy shows that a bacterial PRODH catalyzes the oxidation of the S-enantiomer of B32G, a necessary first step in mechanism-based inactivation. In contrast, the enzyme does not react with the R-enantiomer. Enzyme activity assays show that S-B32G inhibits bacterial PRODH in a time-dependent manner consistent with covalent inactivation; however, the inactivation efficiency is ∼600-times lower than NPPG. We generated the crystal structure of PRODH inactivated by S-B32G at 1.68 Å resolution and found that inactivation induces a covalent link between the FAD N5 and the ε-nitrogen of an active site lysine, confirming that S-B32G follows the same mechanism as NPPG. Despite its lower inactivation efficiency at the purified bacterial enzyme, S-B32G exhibited comparable activity to NPPG against PRODH and PRODH2 in human cells and mouse livers. Molecular modeling is used to rationalize the stereospecificity of B32G. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39870289/ """,

In this issue of Cancer Cell, Ma et al. delineate a novel mechanism linking defects in mitochondrial metabolism as elicited by prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4HA1) to T cell exhaustion and reduced tumor sensitivity to immunotherapy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39933894/ """,
""" 39927190: INTRODUCTION: The development of an intestinal stricture in patients with Crohn's disease represents an important and frequent complication, reflecting the progressive nature of the disease. Depending on the inflammatory and fibrotic composition of the stricture, intensified medical therapy, interventional endoscopy, or surgical intervention is required. However, currently available diagnostic approaches can only assess the level of inflammation, but not the degree of fibrosis, limiting rational therapeutic management of Crohn's disease patients. Recently, prolyl endopeptidase fibroblast activating protein (FAP) has been functionally implicated in fibrotic tissue remodelling, indicating it as a promising target for detection of sites of fibrotic tissue remodelling. Thus, intestinal fibrosis might be visualized using Gallium-68 labelled inhibitors of FAP (FAPI). While F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is a standard diagnostic tool for visualizing inflammatory processes, we combined Ga-68-FAPI-46-PET/CT and F-18-FDG-PET/CT to differentiate predominantly fibrotic or inflammatory areas in Crohn's disease patients with ileo-colonic strictures. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39927190/ """,
