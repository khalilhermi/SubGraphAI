""" 39942796: Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) catalyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) hydrolysis, playing a crucial role in the cAMP signaling pathway. cAMP is a secondary messenger involved in numerous physiological functions, such as inflammatory responses, immune responses, neural activity, learning, and memory. PDE4 inhibition is important for controlling anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular functions and properties of human PDE4s. The study presents detailed sequence information for the PDE4 isoforms and the structural properties of the catalytic domain in members of the PDE4 family. We also review the inhibitory effects of the PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast and cilomilast related to respiratory diseases in PDE4. The crystal structures of PDE4 in complex with roflumilast and cilomilast are also analyzed. This review provides useful information for the future design of novel PDE4 inhibitors. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39942796/ """,
""" 39818700: Multiacting receptor-targeting antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants stimulate various neurotransmitter receptors despite the different targets of postsynaptic receptors and presynaptic reuptake transporters. Their auxiliary and adverse effects may be caused by multiple targets or the modification of the neuronal membrane. To evaluate the membrane responses to olanzapine, imipramine, desipramine, amitriptyline, lidocaine, and dibucaine, we examined the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine liposomes. By contrast, their effects on membrane fluidity were measured as the suppressive contributions of the inhibitory activity of Trolox on lipid oxidation. These drugs inhibit lipid peroxidation and exclude harmful reactive oxygen species and the protective effect of Trolox. The fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene in saturated phospholipid liposome-containing drugs suggested that olanzapine, imipramine, and dibucaine enhanced membrane fluidity. The radical scavenging activity of 2,2-diphenylpicrylhidrazyl and galvinoxyl radicals was determined using electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, and their molecular flexibility was determined using thermograms for differential scanning calorimetry. Multiple regression analyses of the linear free energy relationship approach and comparative investigations revealed that the membranous fluidity of the liposomes, independent of the radical scavenging activity of the drugs, induced the inhibitory activity on lipid peroxidation. We discussed how these drugs act on nervous membranes and aimed to identify the relationship between uncertified functions and membranous fluidity. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39818700/ """,
""" 39956933: Skin wound repair, a highly integrated and overlapping complex process, is susceptible to infection, excessive inflammation, high oxidative stress, which can prolong the wound healing time or even lead to chronic wound. Meanwhile, single-layer hydrogels are unavoidably dehydrated usually due to water evaporation, which is not conducive to wound healing. Therefore, a bilayer hydrogel dressing composed of gelatin (G) and sodium alginate (A) loaded with ciprofloxacin (C) and curcumin (Cur) was manufactured by extrusion 3D bioprinting technology in this study, which is denoted as GACCur. The experimental results showed that the bilayer hydrogel loaded with 50 µg/mL of Cur (GACCur50) had excellent antibacterial properties and high antioxidative activity with a 54.35 ± 0.48% DPPH scavenging ratio. In addition, this GACCur50 bilayer hydrogel exhibited the capacity to mitigate the polarization of inflammatory cells toward pro-inflammatory states, observably reducing the expression of pertinent pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the bilayer hydrogel dressing also showed good biocompatibility as assessed by live-dead fluorescent staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and CCK-8 test. Therefore, the GACCur50 bilayer hydrogel dressing is promising for wound healing. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956933/ """,

""" 39945506: A sedentary lifestyle can lead to motor and cognitive deficits, increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases in ageing. Emerging hypotheses suggest that these functional alterations may be related to energy metabolism. Indeed, ATP produced by mitochondria is essential for muscle contraction, neurotransmission and brain plasticity processes. Although a sedentary lifestyle has been associated with mitochondrial alterations in skeletal muscle, the potential effects on brain structures have yet to be investigated. The present study aimed to determine whether early sensorimotor restriction (SMR) alters mitochondrial metabolism in rat muscles and brain structures. Enzyme activities of citrate synthase (CS) and respiratory chain complexes I, II and IV were measured using a spectrophotometric technique and mitochondrial respiration was assessed using high-resolution respirometry in two hind limb muscles [soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL)] and four brain structures (sensorimotor cortex, striatum, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) in control rats and rats experiencing early SMR from birth to day 28. Mitochondrial enzyme activities decreased in the soleus (complexes I and II), in the EDL (complex I) and in the hippocampus (complexes I and IV) in an age-dependent manner, whereas no effect was observed in other brain structures. CS activity decreases in the soleus and increases transiently in the striatum and sensorimotor cortex at postnatal day 15. Mitochondrial respiration was reduced in the soleus and in the sensorimotor cortex (CI and CI+CII). Early SMR appears to induce quantitative and qualitative mitochondrial alterations in skeletal muscles and certain brain structures involved in cognitive and motor processes. KEY POINTS: Early sensorimotor restriction (SMR) alters mitochondrial enzyme activities and mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscles and brain. Mitochondrial alterations induced by early SMR are age-dependent, structure-dependent and complex-dependent. Mitochondrial enzyme activities increase during development and the evolution pattern is specific to the different structures. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39945506/ """,
""" 39956232: Extended gastric residence of drugs can enhance the therapeutic effect, increase bioavailability, improve efficacy, and reduce the number of required doses by prolonging the retention of the drug delivery system. A new floating drug delivery for Ondansetron was designed and evaluated. Pre-formulation studies included the assessment of powder flow properties and drug-excipient compatibility. In-vitro release studies and a buoyancy test were performed to characterize the performance of the system. The study evaluated the properties of Ondansetron tablets. The optimized batches had compressibility index values ranging from 7.272 % to 25 %, with percentage weight fluctuation ranging from 0 to 1.05 %. The tablets were 2.92 and 3.52 mm thick, hardness between 3.50 and 4.65 kg/cm2, and loss percentages between 0.12 and 0.68 %, except batch T8, which had high friability index values of 1.02. Thermo-gravimetric analysis and Differential scanning Calorimetry showed no interaction between the drug and other polymers. Formulations showed a sustained release of the drug for periods of &gt;12 h for several compositions, while some showed a release of &gt;90 %. The formulations with HPMC K4M showed slower drug release due to a strong hydro layer. Citric acid content increased drug release, suggesting modulation of drug release kinetics. Kinetic modeling revealed that some of the formulations exhibited zero-order release kinetics, which means that the drug is released at a constant rate to maintain a steady level of the drug in the body. This project aims to improve the therapeutic effect of Class I Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS I) drug ondansetron by using a stomach-retaining, floating drug delivery system.

""" 39952130: Antibiotic resistance represents a growing global health crisis, predominantly driven by the selective pressure imposed by antibiotics, which facilitates horizontal gene transfer. However, the potential role of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in promoting or enabling the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) remains poorly understood. This study provided novel insights into the capacity of clofibric acid, a lipid-lowering drug, to enhance the conjugative transfer of ARGs, and deeply explored the underlying multiple mechanisms. The findings revealed that clofibric acid, at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 μg/L, significantly promoted the transfer efficiency of the RP4 plasmid carrying multiple ARGs. This enhancement was accompanied by a cascade of stress responses in bacterial cells, including elevated production of reactive oxygen species, increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances, reduced bacterial surface zeta potential, and heightened cell membrane permeability. The physiological alterations were closely linked to significant changes in the expression of genes associated with these processes. Our results highlighted the potential of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals to contribute to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, offering a critical foundation for further research into the environmental and public health implications of such compounds. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39952130/ """,
""" 39955176: Neuromodulation therapy using chemogenetic stimulation has shown potential in enhancing motor recovery and neuroregeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). These therapeutic benefits are hypothesized to result from the promotion of neuroplasticity, particularly when administered during the acute phase of injury. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemogenetic stimulation using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in conjunction with clozapine, a ligand for receptor activation. DREADDs enable targeted, reversible neuromodulation, facilitating the histological characterization of engineered neurons. We utilized these receptors to modulate G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, leading to the activation or inhibition of intracellular signaling. The objective was to determine whether the administration of DREADDs and clozapine (0.1 ​mg/kg) could enhance motor function and neuronal recovery, particularly when applied during the acute phase of SCI. Weekly behavioral assessments demonstrated significant improvements in motor skills and neuronal regeneration in treated animals compared to controls, with the most pronounced effects observed when stimulation was initiated early after injury. These enhancements in neuroplasticity were reflected in improved ladder rung test scores and Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale results in DREADDs-treated rats. Histological analyses, including immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, Western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), confirmed that the treatment group exhibited a higher density of neurons, increased signaling protein expression, and reduced inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that chemogenetic stimulation, particularly when administered during the acute phase, effectively promotes neuroregeneration and motor recovery. Future research should focus on assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of chemogenetic virus injection and clozapine administration, with an emphasis on the timing of intervention. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955176/ """,

""" 39955915: Blood coagulation, the tightly regulated biological process prevents bleeding upon injury to the blood vessels. Vessel injury exposes the sub-endothelial tissue factor (TF) to the blood stream, thereby leading to the binding of coagulation protease, factor VII/activated VII with TF, and thus initiating the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Apart from coagulation, FVIIa also promotes intracellular signaling via the activation of a unique class of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family protein, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), thereby promoting anti-inflammation and endothelial barrier protection. Blood coagulation and inflammation are intrinsically connected, the activation of one process often leads to the activation of the other. The present review highlights the mechanisms by which FVIIa contributes to cytoprotective responses, either by direct action or through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from vascular endothelium. FVIIa, due to its well-known ability to promote coagulation, is also used as a hemostatic agent in the treatment of several hyper bleeding disorders like hemophilia, thrombocytopenia etc. In addition to its hemostatic role, the topics discussed in the present review open a new therapeutic off-label effect of FVIIa, i.e., providing anti-inflammatory and vascular protective responses in several bleeding disorders and beyond. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955915/ """,
""" 39930412: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process whereby epithelial cells are transformed into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. The transcription factor, X-box binding protein 1 splicing variant (XBP1s) is a key regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERS); but the function of XBP1s in the endometritis-induced EMT process remains unclear. Here we found that uterine tissues from goats with endometritis exhibited an EMT phenotype, with a significant decrease in the epithelial cell polarity marker E-cadherin and a significant increase in the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. We also found that sustained LPS treatment induced EMT in goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs), along with ERS and XBP1s overexpression. XBP1s KO significantly inhibited LPS-induced EMT and migration in gEECs, while XBP1s overexpression showed the opposite result. CUT & Tag experiments performed on XBP1s revealed that MAP3K2 was a downstream target gene for XBP1s regulation. We also found that expression of MAP3K2 was positively correlated with XBP1s expression in uterine tissues of goats with endometritis and in gEECs. Assays for dual luciferase reporter and molecular docking indicated that XBP1s protein regulated the transcription of MAP3K2 by modulating promoter activity. The knockdown of MAP3K2 expression significantly inhibited the migration and EMT of gEECs. XBP1s and MAP3K2 significantly promoted phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, activating the MAPK/ERK pathway. Treatment with the MAPK/ERK inhibitor, PD98059, reversed the effects of XBP1s and MAP3K2 overexpression on LPS-induced EMT.

Studies confirmed that CPT1A enhances SREBP1 activation, upregulating SCD1 expression, and promoting lipid desaturation in OCSCs. Mechanistic studies reveal that CPT1A promotes succinylation of mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) through its lysine succinyltransferase (LSTase) activity, crucial for mitochondria-associated membranes formation and SREBP1 activation. Inhibiting CPT1A's LSTase activity with Glyburide reduces OCSCs' stemness and enhances cisplatin's anti-tumor effects against ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.

This study investigates how the supramolecular organization of LPS-monomers, micelles, and bilayers-affects FXII activation. We demonstrate that LPS micelles uniquely activate FXII to its enzymatic form (FXIIa), while monomeric LPS modulates FXIIa activity without direct activation, and bilayer-form LPS does not induce FXII activation. The addition of calcium ions (Ca2+) promoted the formation of bilayers by binding to the negatively charged phosphate groups of LPS, reducing electrostatic repulsion and stabilizing LPS aggregates, potentially leading to a shift in their net charge.

Rhodibalamins, the rhodium analogs of cobalamins, have been described as antimetabolites due to their ability to inhibit bacterial growth. In this study, we have examined the reactivity of adenosylrhodibalamin (AdoRhbl) with two key human chaperones, MMACHC (also known as CblC) and adenosyltransferase (MMAB, also known as ATR), and with the human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MMUT. We demonstrate that while AdoRhbl binds tightly to all four proteins, the Rh-carbon bond is resistant to homolytic (on MMAB and MMUT) as well as heterolytic (on MMACHC) rupture. On the other hand, MMAB catalyzes Rh-carbon bond formation, converting rhodi(I)balamin in the presence of ATP to AdoRhbl. We report the first crystal structure of a rhodibalamin (AdoRhbl) bound to a B<sub>12</sub> protein, i.e., MMAB, in the presence of triphosphate, which shows a weakened but intact Rh-carbon bond. The structure provides insights into how MMAB cleaves the corresponding Co-carbon bond in a sacrificial homolytic reaction that purportedly functions as a cofactor sequestration strategy. Collectively, the study demonstrates that while the noble metal substitution of cobalt by rhodium sets up structural mimicry, it compromises chemistry, which could be exploited for targeting human and bacterial B<sub>12</sub> chaperones and enzymes. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39012171/ """,

Here, we have identified liver X receptor (LXR) agonists as potent inhibitors of STING signaling. We show that stimulation of lipid metabolism by LXR agonists specifically suppressed cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-STING signaling. Moreover, we developed cyclic dinucleotide-conjugated beads to biochemically isolate host effectors for cGAMP inhibition, and we found that LXR ligands stimulated the expression of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3A (SMPDL3A), which is a 2'3'-cGAMP-degrading enzyme. Results of crystal structures suggest that cGAMP analog induces dimerization of SMPDL3A, and the dimerization is critical for cGAMP degradation. Additionally, we have provided evidence that SMPDL3A cleaves cGAMP to restrict STING signaling in cell culture and mouse models.

Cell viability assay and soft agar assay were used to analyze antiproliferative activity of LCD. Flow cytometry was performed to determine effects of LCD on apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dysfunction, and multi-caspase activity in CRC cells. Western blot analysis was used to monitor levels of proteins involved in cell cycle and apoptosis signaling pathways. LCD suppressed the growth and anchorageindependent colony formation of both HCT116 and HCT116-OxR cells. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that LCD induced cell cycle arrest and increased cells in sub-G1 phase. In parallel with the antiproliferative effect of LCD, LCD up-regulated levels of p21 and p27 while downregulating cyclin B1 and cdc2. In addition, phosphorylation levels of JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were increased by LCD. Inhibition of these kinases somehow prevented the antiproliferative effect of LCD. Moreover, LCD increased ROS and deregulated mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the activation of multiple caspases. An ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) or pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK prevented the antiproliferative effect of LCD, supporting that ROS generation and caspase activation mediated LCD-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. In conclusion, LCD exerted antitumor activity in CRC cells by inducing ROS generation and phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK.

""" 39938688: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with hypoxia recognized as a key factor in its progression. Solute carrier family 27 member 5 (SLC27A5/FATP5), a pivotal enzyme in hepatic fatty acid transport and bile acid metabolism, is frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in poor prognosis. However, the link between hypoxia and the suppression of SLC27A5 in HCC remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the hypoxia-induced downregulation of SLC27A5 and its impact on HCC proliferation via the repression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A). Utilizing in vitro and in vivo hepatocellular carcinoma models, we have demonstrated that hypoxic conditions significantly reduce SLC27A5 transcription, which is mediated by the suppression of HNF4A. This reduction leads to the activation of the AKT pathway and an increase in cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) expression, promoting the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle and driving HCC proliferation. Furthermore, we show that the pharmacological activation of HNF4A using Benfluorex, in combination with the AKT inhibitor MK2206, significantly inhibits tumor growth in a subcutaneous MHCC-97H xenograft model, suggesting a synergistic therapeutic potential. Together, our study provides novel insights into the hypoxia-mediated regulatory mechanisms in HCC and highlights the HNF4A/SLC27A5/AKT axis as a promising target for combination therapy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39938688/ """,
""" 38897528: Metastasis poses a huge obstacle to the survival of breast cancer patients. The microRNA miR-1205 acts as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, but its roles in breast cancer and metastasis remain unclear. To elucidate its function in breast cancer progression, we analyzed miR-1205 expression in human tumor samples and carried out a series of functional studies in in vitro and in vivo. miR-1205 was expressed more highly in metastatic breast tumor samples than in non-metastatic samples and was associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and poor prognosis. Moreover, miR-1205 promoted breast cancer cell invasiveness in vitro and metastasis in mice by directly targeting CDK3 and reducing CDK3 protein levels. We also showed that CDK3 interacts with Snail protein, inducing Snail degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and potentially affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, analysis of clinical tissue samples indicated that CDK3 and miR-1205 levels were inversely correlated in lymph node metastasis-positive primary tumors. This study demonstrated the pro-metastatic role of miR-1205 in breast cancer, mediated via a novel miR-1205/CDK3/Snail axis. Moreover, we identified miR-1205 and CDK3 as potential markers of invasion and progression in breast cancer. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38897528/ """,

""" 39937180: The circadian clock enables organisms to synchronize biochemical and physiological processes over a 24 hr period. Natural changes in lighting conditions, as well as artificial disruptions like jet lag or shift work, can advance or delay the clock phase to align physiology with the environment. Within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, circadian timekeeping and resetting rely on both membrane depolarization and intracellular second-messenger signaling. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) facilitate calcium influx in both processes, activating intracellular signaling pathways that trigger Period (Per) gene expression. However, the precise mechanism by which these processes are concertedly gated remains unknown. Our study in mice demonstrates that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and regulates phase shifts of the circadian clock. We observed that knocking down Cdk5 in the SCN of mice affects phase delays but not phase advances. This is linked to uncontrolled calcium influx into SCN neurons and an unregulated protein kinase A (PKA)-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. Consequently, genes such as Per1 are not induced by light in the SCN of Cdk5 knock-down mice. Our experiments identified Cdk5 as a crucial light-modulated kinase that influences rapid clock phase adaptation. This finding elucidates how light responsiveness and clock phase coordination adapt activity onset to seasonal changes, jet lag, and shift work. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937180/ """,

""" 39948068: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a leading cause of low back pain, with limited effective treatments due to an incomplete understanding of disease mechanisms. In this study, we report that circFUNDC1, a nuclear circular RNA, is markedly downregulated in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) from patients with end-stage IVDD. CircFUNDC1 is derived from the gene encoding the FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1) protein, which is essential for mitophagy and cell survival. Functional analyses reveal that circFUNDC1 plays a crucial role in maintaining extracellular matrix homeostasis by enhancing the expression of anabolic factors in NPCs. Additionally, we identified the transcriptional regulator cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as a novel binding partner for circFUNDC1. Binding with circFUNDC1 recruits CDK9 via complementary nucleotides to the FUNDC1 promoter to stimulate the production of full-length FUNDC1 mRNAs and proteins, forming a positive feedback loop. Overexpression of circFUNDC1 protects NPCs from oxidative stress by promoting mitophagy, reducing reactive oxygen species levels, and inhibiting cellular senescence. Moreover, circFUNDC1 overexpression delays the onset of IVDD in an ex-vivo culture model. This study is the first to demonstrate that circFUNDC1 is vital for protecting NPCs from oxidative stress, suggesting circFUNDC1 as a potential therapeutic target for IVDD. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39948068/ """,

""" 39953321: Therapeutic drug monitoring for immunosuppressants is a widely conducted global practice. Traditionally, the pretreatment of whole blood involves the use of metal ions combined with organic solvents. However, this method requires multiple reagent additions, repeated opening, closing, and vortexing of vials, and it also leads to heavy metal pollution. Given the typically large sample volumes, optimizing this process is crucial for increasing throughput, reducing the workload of clinical staff, and lowering costs. We discovered that treating whole blood with a 60 to 75% acetonitrile (ACN) solution effectively releases tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine A while simultaneously precipitating protein. This allowed us to significantly simplify the pretreatment process to just adding 65% ACN solution containing internal standards, manually shaking for 20 s, and centrifuging for 2 min. The resulted supernatant can then be directly analyzed by mass spectrometry. Method validation demonstrated that the new approach can accurately quantify tacrolimus in the range of 0.64 to 37.5 ng/ml, cyclosporine A at 12 to 976 ng/ml, and sirolimus at 0.99 to 43.4 ng/ml. A comparison of paired samples showed the new method to be perfectly consistent with the classical method, with 293 out of 300 results deviating by no more than ± 20%. This study has greatly simplified the workflow, increased throughput, and resolved environmental concerns for therapeutic drug monitoring of immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine A, in whole blood samples.

In this study, we examined the activity of these compounds and analyzed the mechanisms of action in relation to another important class of ionotropic glutamate receptors-calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors (CI-AMPARs) - using the whole-cell patch-clamp method on isolated male Wistar rat brain neurons. Gabexate and camostat were found to be inactive. Other compounds preferentially inhibited calcium-permeable AMPA receptors with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 30-60 µM. DAPI and furamidine were also active against CI-AMPARs with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 50-60 μM, while others showed poor activity. All active compounds acted as channel blockers, which are able for permeating into the cytoplasm on both CP- and CI-AMPARs. Specifically, sepimostat showed trapping in the closed CP-AMPAR channel. Furamidine and DAPI demonstrated a voltage-independent action on CI-AMPARs, indicating binding to an additional superficial site. While the majority of compounds inhibited glutamate-activated steady-state currents as well as kainate-activated currents on CI-AMPARs, pentamidine significantly potentiated glutamate-induced steady-state responses.

Here we investigate the effect of widely prescribed AEDs (carbamazepine and valproic acid) on CYP1A1 regulation and the levels of estradiol and calcium in cell supernatants of hepatocellular, HepG2, and neuronal, SH-SY5Y cells. We observed that both the AEDs significantly increased CYP1A1 expression and enzyme activity, which was accompanied by a decrease in estradiol and calcium levels in HepG2 cells. This induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein was fully prevented by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) knockdown and StemRegenin 1 (SR1) antagonism. Notably, the AEDs did not affect the AHR expression but regulated its nuclear translocation, potentially driving the transcriptional upregulation of CYP1A1. Furthermore, the knockdown of CYP1A1 in HepG2 cells elucidated a marked increase in estradiol and calcium levels. Later, this increase subsided upon AED exposure. Lastly, we observed a similar trend in estradiol and calcium alterations in SH-SY5Y cells on AED exposure, speculating the involvement of CYP1A1 induction via AEDs at neuronal sites.

Additionally, the safety of coadministering these drugs with omaveloxolone was assessed. Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole significantly increased omaveloxolone maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>) by approximately 3- and 4-fold, respectively. Conversely, coadministration with the moderate CYP3A4 inducer efavirenz decreased C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> of omaveloxolone by 38.0% and 48.5%, respectively. Omaveloxolone exposure was also increased following coadministration with verapamil, a moderate CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, but it was unaffected by the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil. Coadministration of omaveloxolone reduced systemic exposure of the substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, breast cancer resistance protein, and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 but had no effect on those of P-gp and organic cation transporter 1. Omaveloxolone was well tolerated when administered alone and in combination with the DME and DT modulators or substrates. These findings support concomitant medication precautions and dosing recommendations for omaveloxolone when coadministered with a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer, as well as the substrates of certain CYP450 enzymes or transporters. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39920097/ """,
""" 39474049: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) derivatives have a widespread presence in the environment and even the human body, but their metabolism and potential risk remain unclear. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory to calculate the metabolic mechanism of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), an important PAH derivative. The results showed that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can metabolize 1-NP, with CYP 2A13 and CYP 2E1 being important enzyme isoforms, because they had lower binding affinities (-16.48 and -13.90 kcal/mol) to 1-NP than other CYPs (-2.38 to -7.89 kcal/mol). Additionally, these CYPs can metabolize 1-NP through epoxidation and hydroxylation pathways. Compared to hydroxylation, epoxidation had a lower energy barrier of 9.42 kcal/mol, and 4,5-epoxide-1-nitropyrene and 9,10-epoxide-1-nitropyrene were identified as the major epoxidation products through electrophilic addition. In addition, 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene and 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene were the major hydroxylated metabolites. Health risks revealed that electrophilicity of epoxides increased the risk of binding to DNA, and both 1-NP and its four important metabolites cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system and lung. In summary, this study revealed the metabolic mechanism of 1-NP by human CYPs and formation of toxic metabolites, and more attention should be paid to the nitro-derivatives of PAHs in the future. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474049/ """,
""" 39937310: Microsomal cytochromes P450 (micCYPs) are monooxygenases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and other endomembranes of human cells. micCYPs receive electrons from specific redox partners and perform enzymatic transformations of drugs and different endogenous substrates. The large biodiversity of micCYPs leads to the idea that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving micCYPs are not limited to classical redox partners. This review aims to perform a systems biology analysis of the complete set of PPIs for all 33 micCYPs studied, as well as to examine the subinteractome of each micCYP. We have retrieved 287 PPIs from interactomic databases, involving 246 unique protein interactors that share a similar profile of subcellular localization with micCYPs. The number of protein interactors per micCYP unevenly varies from one to 47. Interactors of micCYPs are involved in cellular metabolism, signal transduction, cell-cell junctions, cytoskeleton organization, and intracellular or transmembrane transport. Notably, up to one-third of all interactors belong to the latter group, half of which consists of membrane transporters of compounds, metabolites, and ions (e.g., CACNA2D1, ORAI1, SCN3B, SLC7A2, SLC19A3, and SLC11A2). The CYP2C8 subinteractome is enriched with proteins involved in autophagy; CYP2S1- ERBB2 and EPH-Ephrin signaling; CYP3A4- glucuronidation. Proteins UBC, PGRMC1, and FANCG are the most frequent common interactors across various micCYPs. Nine and 12 interactors of micCYPs are involved in phosphorylation and ubiquitination, respectively; 20 interactors are 'moonlighting' proteins that are represented in the CYP3A4 subinteractome. Furthermore, micCYPs such as CYP2C9, 3A5, 2E1, 2A6, 4F2, and 4A11 may be involved in potentially binary interactions with other micCYPs. The functional implication of these CYP-CYP pairs is likely associated with modulation of their activity. Analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that some micCYP/interactor pairs exhibit tissue-, time-, and disease-specific gene expression patterns. Drugs that are metabolized by micCYPs in some cases can influence the expression of corresponding interactors at the gene or protein levels. These findings suggest that micCYPs may play roles in functions beyond their monooxygenase activity, as indicated by the spectrum of PPIs analyzed. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937310/ """,
""" 36726312: Sequencing of the protein coding genome has revealed many different missense mutations of human proteins and different population frequencies of corresponding haplotypes, which consist of different sets of those mutations. Here, we present evidence for pairwise intramolecular epistasis (i.e., nonadditive interactions) between many such mutations through an analysis of protein dynamics. We suggest that functional compensation for conserving protein dynamics is a likely evolutionary mechanism that maintains high-frequency mutations that are individually nonneutral but epistatically compensating within proteins. This analysis is the first of its type to look at human proteins with specific high population frequency mutations and examine the relationship between mutations that make up that observed high-frequency protein haplotype. Importantly, protein dynamics revealed a separation between high and low frequency haplotypes within a target protein cytochrome P450 2A7, with the high-frequency haplotypes showing behavior closer to the wild-type protein. Common protein haplotypes containing two mutations display dynamic compensation in which one mutation can correct for the dynamic effects of the other. We also utilize a dynamics-based metric, EpiScore, that evaluates the epistatic interactions and allows us to see dynamic compensation within many other proteins. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36726312/ """,

""" 39284705: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily represents the major drug-metabolizing enzymes responsible for metabolizing over 65% of therapeutic drugs, including those for pediatric use. CYP-ontogeny based physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling has emerged as useful approach to mechanistically extrapolate adult pharmacokinetic data to children. However, these models integrate physiological differences in the pediatric population including age-dependent differences in the abundances of CYP enzymes. Conventionally, developmental changes in CYP enzymes have been reported using protein abundance and activity data from subcellular fractions such as microsomes, which are prone to high technical variability. Similarly, the available pediatric pharmacokinetic data suffer from the lack of specific CYP substrates, especially in younger children. In the present study, we used viable hepatocytes from 50 pediatric (age, 1 day-18 years) and 8 adult human donors and carried out global proteomics-based quantification of all major hepatic CYP enzymes, including orphan enzymes that have not been studied previously. While CYPs 2B6, 3A5, 4A11, 4F3, and 4V2 did not show a significant association with age, all other quantified isoforms either increased or decreased with age. CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 2C18, and 2C19 were absent or barely detected in the neonatal group, while CYP3A7 was the highest in this group. The >1 to 2 years age group showed the highest total abundance of all CYP enzymes. The age-dependent differences in CYP enzymes reported in this study can be used to develop ontogeny-based PBPK models, which in turn can help improve pediatric dose prediction based on adult dosing, leading to safer drug pharmacology in children.

Here, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling networks present a new avenue for exploring such complex scenarios, potentially informing clinical guidelines and handling patient-specific DDGIs at the bedside. Moreover, they provide an established framework for drug-drug interaction (DDI) submissions to regulatory agencies. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme is particularly prone to DDGIs due to the high prevalence of genetic variation and common use of CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs. In this study, we present a comprehensive PBPK network covering CYP2D6 drug-gene interactions (DGIs), DDIs, and DDGIs. The network covers sensitive and moderate sensitive substrates, and strong and weak inhibitors of CYP2D6 according to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. For the analyzed CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors, DD(G)Is mediated by CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein were included. Overall, the network comprises 23 compounds and was developed based on 30 DGI, 45 DDI, and seven DDGI studies, covering 32 unique drug combinations.

The location of the transgene provides valuable information for assessing potential effects of the transgenesis on the host and for designing genotyping protocols that can amplify across the integration site, but it is challenging to identify. Here, we report the successful utility of optical genome mapping technology to identify the transgene insertion site in a CYP2A13/2B6/2F1-transgenic mouse model, which produces three human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes (CYP2A13, CYP2B6, and CYP2F1) that are encoded by neighboring genes on human chromosome 19. These enzymes metabolize many drugs, respiratory toxicants, and chemical carcinogens. Initial efforts to identify candidate insertion sites by whole genome sequencing was unsuccessful, apparently because the transgene is located in a region of the mouse genome that contains highly repetitive sequences. Subsequent utility of the optical genome mapping approach, which compares genome-wide marker distribution between the transgenic mouse genome and a reference mouse (GRCm38) or human (GRCh38) genome, localized the insertion site to mouse chromosome 14, between two marker positions at 4451324 base pair and 4485032 base pair. A transgene-mouse genome junction sequence was further identified through long-polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing at GRCm38 Chr.14:4484726.

Lipid binding to recombinant FABP1 with a fluorophore displacement assay showed substantial preference of FABP1 for ≥16-carbon fatty acids (K<sub>d</sub> &lt; 70 nM). Comparison of palmitate-binding studies revealed that FABP1 bound the lipid &gt;100-fold more tightly than P450 4A11. Tight binding of P450 4A11 to Alexa-488 dye-labeled FABP1 was observed in fluorescence assays, and the interaction was dependent on ionic strength (K<sub>d</sub> = 3-124 nM). Kinetic studies with Alexa-FABP1 indicated that the rate of protein-protein association is fast (∼2 s-1), and a palmitate delivery experiment suggested that substrate transfer (from FABP1 to P450) is not rate limiting. From these results, we constructed a kinetic model of the FABP1-P450 interaction and applied it to a catalytic study of FABP1 on P450 4A11 palmitate ω-hydroxylation, the results of which conclusively rejected the free ligand hypothesis. Our results are explained by a direct transfer model in which lipid-bound FABP1 interacts with P450 4A11, transfers the substrate, and a slower P450 conformational change follows to position the molecule in a mode for oxidation. Given the limited free lipid pool in vivo, interaction with FABP1 may be a dominant mechanism by which P450 4A11 accesses its substrates and may offer a novel means to target P450 4A11 activity. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39793892/ """,

""" 38602333: A growing body of literature has linked early-life exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) with adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Once in the body, metabolism serves as a powerful mediator of PAH toxicity by bioactivating and detoxifying PAH metabolites. Since enzyme expression and activity vary considerably throughout human development, we evaluated infant metabolism of PAHs as a potential contributing factor to PAH susceptibility. We measured and compared rates of phenanthrene and retene (two primary PAH constituents of woodsmoke) metabolism in human hepatic microsomes from individuals ≤21 months of age to a pooled sample (n = 200) consisting primarily of adults. We used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to characterize cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) in the same hepatic microsome samples. Once incubated in microsomes, phenanthrene demonstrated rapid depletion. Best-fit models for phenanthrene metabolism demonstrated either 1 or 2 phases, depending on the sample, indicating that multiple enzymes could metabolize phenanthrene. We observed no statistically significant differences in phenanthrene metabolism as a function of age, although samples from the youngest individuals had the slowest phenanthrene metabolism rates. We observed slower rates of retene metabolism compared with phenanthrene also in multiple phases. Rates of retene metabolism increased in an age-dependent manner until adult (pooled) metabolism rates were achieved at ∼12 months. ABPP identified 28 unique CYPs among all samples, and we observed lower amounts of active CYPs in individuals ≤21 months of age compared to the pooled sample. Phenanthrene metabolism correlated to CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2C8, 4A22, 3A4, and 3A43 and retene metabolism correlated to CYPs 1A1, 1A2, and 2C8 measured by ABPP and vendor-supplied substrate marker activities. These results will aid efforts to determine human health risk and susceptibility to PAHs exposure during early life. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38602333/ """,
""" 39937310: Microsomal cytochromes P450 (micCYPs) are monooxygenases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and other endomembranes of human cells. micCYPs receive electrons from specific redox partners and perform enzymatic transformations of drugs and different endogenous substrates. The large biodiversity of micCYPs leads to the idea that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving micCYPs are not limited to classical redox partners. This review aims to perform a systems biology analysis of the complete set of PPIs for all 33 micCYPs studied, as well as to examine the subinteractome of each micCYP. We have retrieved 287 PPIs from interactomic databases, involving 246 unique protein interactors that share a similar profile of subcellular localization with micCYPs. The number of protein interactors per micCYP unevenly varies from one to 47. Interactors of micCYPs are involved in cellular metabolism, signal transduction, cell-cell junctions, cytoskeleton organization, and intracellular or transmembrane transport. Notably, up to one-third of all interactors belong to the latter group, half of which consists of membrane transporters of compounds, metabolites, and ions (e.g., CACNA2D1, ORAI1, SCN3B, SLC7A2, SLC19A3, and SLC11A2). The CYP2C8 subinteractome is enriched with proteins involved in autophagy; CYP2S1- ERBB2 and EPH-Ephrin signaling; CYP3A4- glucuronidation. Proteins UBC, PGRMC1, and FANCG are the most frequent common interactors across various micCYPs. Nine and 12 interactors of micCYPs are involved in phosphorylation and ubiquitination, respectively; 20 interactors are 'moonlighting' proteins that are represented in the CYP3A4 subinteractome. Furthermore, micCYPs such as CYP2C9, 3A5, 2E1, 2A6, 4F2, and 4A11 may be involved in potentially binary interactions with other micCYPs. The functional implication of these CYP-CYP pairs is likely associated with modulation of their activity. Analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that some micCYP/interactor pairs exhibit tissue-, time-, and disease-specific gene expression patterns. Drugs that are metabolized by micCYPs in some cases can influence the expression of corresponding interactors at the gene or protein levels. These findings suggest that micCYPs may play roles in functions beyond their monooxygenase activity, as indicated by the spectrum of PPIs analyzed. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937310/ """,
""" 39915454: Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) are closely related nuclear receptors with overlapping regulatory functions in xenobiotic clearance but distinct roles in endobiotic metabolism. Car activation has been demonstrated to ameliorate hypercholesterolemia by regulating cholesterol metabolism and bile acid elimination, whereas PXR activation is associated with hypercholesterolemia and liver steatosis. Here we show a human CAR agonist/PXR antagonist, MI-883, which effectively regulates genes related to xenobiotic metabolism and cholesterol/bile acid homeostasis by leveraging CAR and PXR interactions in gene regulation. Through comprehensive analyses utilizing lipidomics, bile acid metabolomics, and transcriptomics in humanized PXR-CAR-CYP3A4/3A7 mice fed high-fat and high-cholesterol diets, we demonstrate that MI-883 significantly reduces plasma cholesterol levels and enhances fecal bile acid excretion. This work paves the way for the development of ligands targeting multiple xenobiotic nuclear receptors. Such ligands hold the potential for precise modulation of liver metabolism, offering new therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39915454/ """,
