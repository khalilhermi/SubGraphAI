""" 39954596: The gut CD103+ tolerogenic dendritic cells play a key role in maintaining immune balance by inducing oral tolerance, which has been implied in reducing autoimmunity. We recently reported that the oral administration of a fungal protein Lingzhi-8 (LZ-8) prevented autoimmune colitis in mice via maintaining barrier integrity. Here, we examined the functional effect of LZ-8 on gut CD103+ DCs and on autoimmune psoriasis in a mouse model. After orally administered LZ-8 to mice, the numbers of CD103+ DCs and their retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) activities were increased in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), which were associated with increased regulatory T cell (Treg) in the spleen and LNs. This suggests that LZ-8 induces oral tolerance by enhancing the RALDH2 activity of CD103+ DCs. In addition, the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis was attenuated in mice after LZ-8 pretreatment. In the mechanistic study, we generated gut CD103+ DC-like cells from bone marrow (BM) of wild-type mouse and cultured them in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) in vitro. We found that LZ-8 directly enhanced the RALDH2 activity of these RA-primed CD103+ DCs, which was dependent on Dectin-1 and Syk signaling pathways but not TLR4. Together, our study demonstrated that LZ-8 facilitated gut tolerogenic CD103+ DC-mediated immunosuppression by enhancing RALDH2 activity, increasing Treg cell population, and signaling through Dectin-1 and Syk. Our findings provide a novel strategy for treating psoriasis and potentially other autoimmune diseases. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954596/ """,
""" 39747723: Several strategies have been developed in recent years to improve virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine production processes. Among these, the metabolic engineering of cell lines has been one of the most promising approaches. Based on previous work and a proteomic analysis of HEK293 cells producing Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Gag VLPs under transient transfection, four proteins susceptible of enhancing VLP production were identified: ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATR), DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), and retinal rod rhodopsin-sensitive cGMP 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase subunit delta (PDEδ). The knockdown of ATM, ATR, and PDEδ in HEK293 cells increased HIV-1 VLP titers in the supernatant by 3.4-, 2.1-, and 2.2-fold, respectively. Also, possible metabolic synergies between plasmids were investigated by statistical design of experiments (DoE), enabling us to identify the optimal production strategy, that was further demonstrated at lab-scale stirred tank bioreactor operated in perfusion, significantly increasing both VLPs specific and volumetric productivities to 8.3 × 103 VLPs/cellxday and 7.5 × 1012 VLPs/Lxday, respectively. KEY POINTS: • ATM, ATR, and PDEδ knockdowns increased VLP production in HEK293 cells. • Knockdown of ATM increased budding efficiency and extracellular vesicle concentration. • ATM knockdown could be intensified to bioreactor scale operated in perfusion. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39747723/ """,

""" 39954869: Wetland virus (WELV), a newly identified Orthonairovirus phylogenetically related to the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), has recently been shown to cause human infections. A portion of patients infected with WELV usually present with febrile diseases, accompanied by hemorrhagic and neurological symptoms. Currently, there are no reports demonstrating effective therapeutic drugs for the treatment of WELV. In this study, we evaluated the anti-WELV efficacy of five nucleoside analogs: four clinically approved drugs-ribavirin, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and sofosbuvir; and a clinical candidate 4'-fluorouridine. Ribavirin and 4'-fluorouridine strongly inhibited WELV replication in vitro. Remdesivir and molnupiravir showed limited antiviral activity against WELV in Huh7 cells but not in Vero cells, while sofosbuvir did not exhibit inhibitory effects. Utilizing a lethal immunocompetent mouse model of WELV infection, we found that oral administration of relatively low doses of ribavirin (25 mg/kg/day) or 4'-fluorouridine (2.5 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the mortality of WELV-infected mice by decreasing viral titers in tissues and alleviating pathological damage. This treatment strategy retained significant efficacy even when initiated 2 to 4 days after infection. Additionally, we identified mutations G3033R and A3756V in the C-terminal region of the WELV L protein, which may be associated with viral resistance to ribavirin and 4'-fluorouridine. This study revealed varying degrees of anti-WELV efficacy among different nucleoside analogs and identified 4'-fluorouridine as a promising therapeutic candidate and ribavirin as a priority treatment option for WELV infection. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954869/ """,
""" 39956520: Inhibiting post-acidification while preserving viable probiotics in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation is pivotal to preserving quality and probiotic benefits. In this study, following high-pressure processing (HPP) at 400 and 500 MPa for 600 s, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum entered the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. Resuscitation curves, pH levels, acid generation, and glucose metabolism were monitored at 4 °C. VBNC L. plantarum began resuscitation on Day 6 and reached stationary phase by Days 24-27. Glucose metabolism decreased significantly, with no detectable pH drop or acid production, indicating post-acidification was delayed by at least 24 days. Mechanistic insights revealed that post-acidification inhibition was due to HPP-disrupted riboflavin metabolism, related to the cellular respiratory chain and downgraded ATP-depended biosynthesis of NADH, a key coenzyme for lactic acid production. Ultimately, HPP-induced VBNC L. plantarum effectively prevented post-acidification and preserved alive L. plantarum in fermented tomato sauce, verified its ability in real foods. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956520/ """,
""" 39937022: The cryptochromes are flavoproteins that either individually or synergistically respond to light and magnetic field directionality as well as are implicated in circadian rhythm entrainment and development. Single brief exposures (10 min) to low energy (1.5 mT) pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) were previously shown to enhance myogenesis by stimulating transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1)-mediated Ca2+ entry, whereby downwardly directed fields produced greater myogenic enhancement than upwardly directed fields. Here, we show that growth in the dark results in myoblasts losing their sensitivity to both magnetic field exposure and directionality. By contrast, overexpressing or silencing cryptochrome circadian regulator 2 (CRY2) in myoblasts enhances or reduces PEMF responses, respectively, under conditions of ambient light. Reducing cellular flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) content by silencing riboflavin kinase (RFK) attenuated responsiveness to PEMFs and inhibited selectivity for magnetic field direction. The upregulation of TRPC1 and cell cycle regulatory proteins typically observed in response to PEMF exposure was instead attenuated by upwardly directed magnetic fields, growth in the darkness, magnetic shielding, or the silencing of CRY2 or RFK. A physical interaction between CRY2 and TRPC1 was detected using coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, revealing their co-translocation into the nucleus after PEMF exposure. These results implicate CRY2 in an identified TRPC1-dependent magnetotransduction myogenic cascade. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937022/ """,
""" 36866763: The invasiveness of pancreatic cancer and its resistance to anticancer drugs define its malignant potential, and are considered to affect the peritumoral microenvironment. Cancer cells with resistance to gemcitabine exposed to external signals induced by anticancer drugs may enhance their malignant transformation. Ribonucleotide reductase large subunit M1 (RRM1), an enzyme in the DNA synthesis pathway, is upregulated during gemcitabine resistance, and its expression is associated with worse prognosis for pancreatic cancer. However, the biological function of RRM1 is unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated that histone acetylation is involved in the regulatory mechanism related to the acquisition of gemcitabine resistance and subsequent RRM1 upregulation. The current in vitro study indicated that RRM1 expression is critical for the migratory and invasive potential of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis showed that activated RRM1 induced marked changes in the expression levels of extracellular matrix‑related genes, including N‑cadherin, tenascin‑C and COL11A. RRM1 activation also promoted extracellular matrix remodeling and mesenchymal features, which enhanced the migratory invasiveness and malignant potential of pancreatic cancer cells. The present results demonstrated that RRM1 has a critical role in the biological gene program that regulates the extracellular matrix, which promotes the aggressive malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36866763/ """,

Therefore, this study investigates the effects of inhibiting WEE1, by employing AZD1775, on colorectal cancer cells' susceptibility to VE-822-induced DNA damage and apoptosis.SW-480 and HT-29 cells were treated with AZD1775 and VE-822, alone and in combination. MTT assay was used to assess cell proliferation and viability. The mRNA levels of ATR, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), WEE1, ribonucleotide reductase (RR) catalytic subunit M1 (RRM1) and RRM2 were measured by qRT-PCR. Cellular γ-(H2A histone family member X) H2AX levels were measured by Western blot. Analyses were conducted using ELISA to assess 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) levels. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ELISA death assays were used to assess apoptosis.The SW-480 and HT-29 cells have low proliferation rate when treated with VE-822 and AZD1775. The IC50 value for VE-822 was 1.3 μM and 1.6 μM in SW480 and HT-29, respectively. Also, this value for AZD1775 in SW480 was 140 nM and in HT-29 was 185 nM.

Sporadic CRC develops via molecular events that occur early and frequently in the transformation of the normal colon epithelium to invasive cancer. Prevention of sporadic CRC (i.e., CRC chemoprevention) has been a topic of interest in the past decades due to its large public health burden.

This study investigates the potential adipogenic/ lipogenic effects of two commonly prescribed SSRIs, citalopram (CIT) and sertraline (SER), using the murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line. Key markers, such as adiponectin secretion, G3PDH activity, and the expression of critical transcription factors (PPARγ, CEBPα, SREBP1) and lipogenic enzymes (FASN, LPL), were evaluated. Furthermore, assessment of intracellular lipid accumulation via Oil Red O staining was used as a measure for enhanced adipogenesis. The results show that CIT significantly increased adiponectin secretion and G3PDH activity, with comparable potency to the positive control, rosiglitazone. Both SSRIs upregulated the transcription of key adipogenic genes but displayed discrepancies in protein expression. Despite these molecular changes, neither CIT nor SER promoted lipid accumulation, indicating disruption of adipogenic and lipogenic processes without direct stimulation of fat storage.

Nutrient availability in the tumour cell microenvironment and the dimensionality of in vitro tumour cells likely impact on drug responsiveness. Global proteomics experiments were conducted to assess the impact of nutrient availability and dimensionality of culture. Protein set enrichment analyses identified pathways in cancer, focal adhesion and ECM receptor in interaction related to cell culture dimensionality in MDA-MB-231 cells. In MCF-7 cells, 4 pathways were influenced by medium composition, and 2 pathways were influenced by cell culture dimensionality (2D vs. 3D). These pathways were also identified using KEGG analyses. Eight drugs were selected for investigation according to the differential expression of their putative or known target proteins. The influence of medium composition on drug effectiveness was explored using the Melbourne Medium (MM), developed to have nutritionally physiological levels of metabolites as compared with conventional (hyper-nutritional) cell culture medium (CM). The influence of dimensionality on drug effectiveness was also explored, using an innovative 3D viability assessment combining automated confocal microscopy and image analysis. Dimensionality of culture appeared to have a greater influence on the proteome and drug effects than variation in nutrient levels.

To improve the ability of plants to degrade FA, we introduced the E. coli FrmA gene into Arabidopsis thaliana alone (FrmAOE lines) or with FrmB (FrmA/BOE lines). The transgenic seedlings had approximately 30 % longer primary roots and a 20 % higher fresh weight than the control plants. The transgenic plants started flowering four days earlier and had about 30 % more kilo-seed weight than the wild type. FrmA/BOE and FrmAOE accumulated 40 % more reactive oxidative species (ROS) in mesophyll protoplasts and leaf tissue than wild-type plants under normal conditions. In the presence of FA, they produced 92 % and 26 % more glutathione (GSH) and 6 % and 4 % more ascorbate (AsA), respectively, compared to wild-type plants and thus scavenged FA-induced ROS more effectively.

The effects of lipid emulsion on labetalol-induced changes in cell viability, expression of Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9, and phosphorylation of GSK-3β, Akt, and PI3K were examined. Lipid emulsion inhibited labetalol-induced decrease in cell viability, whereas LY294002, MK2206, and SB216763, the inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), respectively, partially attenuated this restoration of cell viability. Lipid emulsion reversed the increase in expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and Bax/Bcl-2 and decrease in the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, Akt, and PI3K by labetalol. Lipid emulsion and cyclosporin, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) inhibitor, reduced the labetalol-induced increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells and promoted late-stage apoptosis. Overall, lipid emulsion inhibited apoptotic cell death caused by labetalol toxicity via the inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic pathway and MPTP in rat cardiomyoblasts, which appears to involve PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β signaling pathways. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39936979/ """,
""" 39956923: The leading cause of death worldwide is cancer. Several studies suggest phenolic acids and metformin as potential cancer treatment options because of their biological and therapeutic properties. So, we synthesized some novel metformin-phenolic acid conjugates. We used an acid-base neutralization method to extract the metformin-free base. N, N`-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)-4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) coupling of phenolic/aromatic acids (benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, para-hydroxybenzoic acid, para coumaric acid, protocatechuic acid, salicylic acid, and vanillic acid) with metformin was performed to produce metformin phenolic acid conjugates (M1-M10). We evaluated the structures using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, FT-IR, and MS. All newly synthesized metformin phenolic acid conjugates were evaluated for their in vitro anti-cancer activity. Metformin phenolic acid conjugates were synthesized and showed a range of inhibitory effects. The metformin-caffeic acid conjugate [(E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-N-(N,N-dimethylcarbamimidoyl)carbamimidoyl)acrylamide] (M3) (IC50: 5.47±2.72 μg/ml and 4.42±2.15 μg/ml) showed the best anticancer activity against MDA-MB-468 and A549 cancer cell lines. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956923/ """,

This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of Pelargonium graveolens (Thunb.) L'Hér leaves in a rotenone-induced PD rat model. The total ethanolic extract and its fractions, obtained via Diaion HP-20 column chromatography, were evaluated for monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibition in vitro. The 50% methanol fraction (PG50) demonstrated the highest MAO-B inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> 5.26 ± 0.12 µg/ml) compared to the reference drug selegiline (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.021 ± 0.003 µg/ml). In a rotenone-induced PD rat model, PG50 (100 mg/kg, p.o.) alleviated motor deficits (assessed via the wire hanging test), and restored norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin levels. PG50 and L-dopa reduced α-synuclein levels by 367.60% and 377.48%, respectively. Oxidative balance was restored with increased glutathione (23.12%) and decreased malondialdehyde (164.19%) in brain tissues. PG50 significantly reduced serum TNF-α (572.79%) and IL-6 (70.84%) levels, and improved succinate dehydrogenase (14.47%) and lactate dehydrogenase (7.74%) activities in brain tissues. Histopathological alterations in the SN were also ceased. UPLC-MS/MS analysis identified 61 metabolites, including 32 flavonoids, 13 phenolic acids, 7 coumarins, 5 phenolic glycosides, and 4 dicarboxylic acids, with in silico docking showing strong MAO-B binding by methoxylated flavonoids like methoxyluteolin dimethyl ether (docking score: - 8.0625 kcal/mol), surpassing that of safinamide (- 8.2615 kcal/mol).

""" 39626031: Pan-cyclin-dependent-kinase (CDK) inhibitors are a new class of targeted therapies that can act on multiple CDKs, with dinaciclib being one of the most promising compounds. Although used as a monotherapy, an interesting approach could be to combine it with radiotherapy. Here, we show that dinaciclib increases radiosensitivity in some experimental models of lung and colon cancer (A549 or HCT 116) but not in others (H1299 or HT-29). Dinaciclib did not alter serine-protein kinase ATM signalling or cell cycle profiling after ionising-radiation exposure, which have been described for other CDK inhibitors. Interestingly, in terms of apoptosis, although the combination renders a clear increase, no potentiation of the ionising-radiation-induced apoptosis was observed. Mechanistically, inhibition of CDK12 by dinaciclib diminishes BRCA1 expression, which decreases homologous recombination (HR) and probably promotes the nonhomologous end joining repair process (NHEJ), which ultimately promotes the induction of ionising-radiation-associated cellular senescence in a TP53-dependent manner, explaining the lack of effect observed in some experimental models. In conclusion, our report proposes a molecular mechanism, based on the signalling axis CDK12-BRCA1, involved in this newly identified therapeutic effect of dinaciclib, although other players implicated in HR should not be discarded. In addition, our data provide a rationale for more selective and personalised chemo/radiotherapy treatment according to the genetic background of the tumour. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39626031/ """,

To identify cancer-driver genes from the regions of SCNA, we have devised a scoring system that integrates information from different genetic alterations. Applying this scoring system to the TCGA-HGSOC dataset (n = 316) we have identified several well-known and novel putative cancer genes in HGSOC. We functionally validated the roles of two previously unknown genes, RNF144B and PPP2R2A. RNF144B, an E3 ubiquitin-ligase is amplified and overexpressed in 16% of HGSOC (TCGA). Overexpression of RNF144B in ovarian cancer cells increased cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. RNF144B was significantly overexpressed in 50% of primary tumors from patients with HGSOC compared to the ovary. Further, it had significantly reduced expression in tumors after chemotherapy.

""" 30862541: Excessive copper can cause neurotoxicity and contribute to the development of some neurological diseases; however, copper neurotoxicity and the potential mechanisms remain poorly understood. We used proteomics and phosphoproteomics to quantify protein changes in the hippocampus of wild-type and 3xTg-AD mice, both of which were treated at 6 months of age with 2 months of drinking water with or without added copper chloride (0.13 ppm concentration). A total of 3960 unique phosphopeptides (5290 phosphorylation sites) from 1406 phosphoproteins was identified. Differentially expressed phosphoproteins involved neuronal and synaptic function, transcriptional regulation, energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. In addition, low-dose copper treatment of wild-type mice decreased hippocampal mitochondrial copy number, mitochondrial biogenesis and disrupted mitochondrial dynamics; these changes were associated with increased hydrogen peroxide production (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), reduced cytochrome oxidase activity and decreased ATP content. In 3xTg-AD mice, identical low-dose oral copper treatment increased axonal degeneration, which was associated with altered phosphorylation of Camk2α at T286 and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2), which involved long-term potentiation (LTP) signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction was mainly related to changes in phosphorylation levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit alpha isoform (Ppp3ca), which involved mitochondrial biogenesis signaling. In sum, low-dose oral copper treatment changes the phosphorylation of key hippocampal proteins involved in mitochondrial, synaptic and axonal integrity. These data showing that excess of copper speeds some early events of AD changes observed suggest that excess circulating copper has the potential to perturb brain function of wild-type mice and exacerbate neurodegenerative changes in a mouse model of AD. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30862541/ """,

We employed shotgun liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomic and metabonomic profiling approaches on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal (HPC) tissue from Df(16)A+/- mice, a model of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Proteomic results were compared with previous transcriptomic profiling studies of the same brain regions. The aim was to investigate how the combined effect of the 22q11.2 deletion and the corresponding miRNA dysregulation affects the cell biology at the systems level. The proteomic brain profiling analysis revealed PFC and HPC changes in various molecular pathways associated with chromatin remodelling and RNA transcription, indicative of an epigenetic component of the 22q11.2DS. Further, alterations in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial function and lipid biosynthesis were identified. Metabonomic profiling substantiated the proteomic findings by identifying changes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)-related pathways, such as changes in ceramide phosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin, carnitines, tyrosine derivates and panthothenic acid. The proteomic findings were confirmed using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, validating decreased levels of several proteins encoded on 22q11.2, increased levels of the computationally predicted putative miR-185 targets UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 110 kDa subunit (OGT1) and kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A and alterations in the non-miR-185 targets serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit gamma isoform, neurofilament light chain and vesicular glutamate transporter 1. Furthermore, alterations in the proteins associated with mammalian target of rapamycin signalling were detected in the PFC and with glutamatergic signalling in the hippocampus. Based on the proteomic and metabonomic findings, we were able to develop a schematic model summarizing the most prominent molecular network findings in the Df(16)A+/- mouse. Interestingly, the implicated pathways can be linked to one of the most consistent and strongest proteomic candidates, (OGT1), which is a predicted miR-185 target.

""" 39875495: Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and de-repression (CCDR) are critical for fungal development and pathogenicity, yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood in pathogenic fungi. Here, we identify a serine/threonine protein phosphatase catalytic subunit, Pp4c, as essential for growth, conidiation, virulence, and the utilization of carbohydrates and lipids in Magnaporthe oryzae. We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase 4 complex (Pp4c and Smek1 subunits), the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) Snf1, and the transcriptional regulators CreA (repressor) and Crf1 (activator) collaboratively regulate the utilization of non-preferred carbon sources. Protein interaction and phosphorylation analyses reveal that under glucose-rich conditions, Snf1 and Smek1 directly regulate the phosphorylation status of CreA and Crf1. In contrast, under L-arabinose-rich conditions, Snf1 indirectly modulates the dephosphorylation of these transcription factors via Pp4c and Smek1. Phosphorylation-mediated activation or inactivation of CreA and Crf1 drives CCR and CCDR, thereby governing the metabolism of carbon sources derived from plant cell walls and contributing to fungal pathogenicity. These findings provide deep insights into the regulation of CCR and CCDR, emphasizing their significance in carbon metabolism and pathogenicity in phytopathogenic fungi. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39875495/ """,

Herein, we introduce a novel bacterial factor, secretion system effector J (SseJ), and its interactive host protein, PHB2 (prohibitin 2). We explored whether SseJ affected S. Typhimurium replication and survival in the host. S. Typhimurium infection caused severe mitochondrial damage and mitophagy, which facilitated S. Typhimurium proliferation in cells. S. Typhimurium SseJ activated the PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1)-PRKN (parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase)-autophagosome-dependent mitophagy pathway, aided by the mitophagy receptor PHB2, for bacterial survival and persistent infection. Moreover, suppression of mitophagy alleviated the pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium. In conclusion, S.

""" 39395782: The serine/threonine Protein Phosphatase-5 (PP5) plays an essential role in regulating hormone and stress-induced signaling networks as well as extrinsic apoptotic pathways in cells. Unlike other Protein Phosphatases, PP5 possesses both regulatory and catalytic domains, and its function is further modulated through post-translational modifications (PTMs). PP5 contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which usually inhibits its phosphatase activity by blocking the active site (closed conformation). Certain activators bind to the PP5-TPR domain, alleviating this inhibition and allowing the catalytic domain to adopt an active (open) conformation. While this mechanism has been proposed based on structural and biophysical studies, PP5 conformational changes and activity have yet to be observed in cells. Here, we designed and developed a flow cytometry-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FC-FRET) method, enabling real-time observation of PP5 autoinhibition and activation within live mammalian cells. By quantifying FRET efficiency using sensitized emission, we established a standardized and adaptable data acquisition workflow. Our findings revealed that, in a cellular context, PP5 exists in multiple conformational states, none of which alone fully predicts its activity. Additionally, we have demonstrated that PTMs such as phosphorylation and SUMOylation impact PP5 conformational changes, representing a significant advancement in our understanding of its regulatory mechanisms. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39395782/ """,

A sub-group of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampus sclerosis (MTLE-HS) have seizures with fear, which is called ictal fear (IF), due to epileptic activity within the brain defensive survival circuit structures. Synaptic transmission efficacy can be bi-directionally modified through potentiation (long-term potentiation (LTP)) or depression (long-term depression (LTD)) as well as the phosphorylation state of Ser831 and Ser845 sites at the GluA1 subunit of the glutamate AMPA receptors, which has been characterized as a critical event for this synaptic plasticity. In this study, GluA1 levels and the phosphorylation at Ser845 and Ser831 in the amygdala (AMY), anterior hippocampus (aHIP) and middle gyrus of temporal neocortex (CX) were determined with western blots and compared between MTLE-HS patients who were showing (n = 06) or not showing (n = 25) IF. Patients with IF had an 11% decrease of AMY levels of the GluA1 subunit (p = 0.05) and a 21.5% decrease of aHIP levels of P-GluA1-Ser845 (p = 0.009) compared to patients not showing IF. The observed associations were not related to imbalances in the distribution of other concomitant types of aura, demographic, clinical or neurosurgical variables. The lower levels of P-GluA1-Ser845 in the aHIP of patients with IF were not related to changes in the levels of the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-alpha catalytic subunit or protein kinase A activation. Taken together, the GluA1 subunit levels in AMY and P-GluA1-Ser845 levels in the aHIP show an overall accuracy of 89.3% (specificity 95.5% and sensitivity 66.7%) to predict the presence of IF. AMY levels of the GluA1 subunit and aHIP levels of P-GluA1-Ser845 were not associated with the psychiatric diagnosis and symptoms of patients. Taken together with previous findings in MTLE-HS patients with IF who were evaluated by stereotactic implanted depth electrodes, we speculate our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that AMY is not a centre of fear but together with other sub-cortical and cortical structures integrates the defensive circuit that detect and respond to threats.

In this article, we evaluated the effectiveness of dsRNA by topical delivery on a species of great agricultural interest, Halyomorpha halys. The specificity of action of the dsRNA was also investigated in Rhodnius prolixus, an insect phylogenetically close to H. halys. Of the three investigated genes (putative ATPase N2B, ATPase, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-β catalytic subunit, PP1, and IAP repeat-containing protein 7-B-like, IAP), IAP and ATPase were able to induce higher mortality in H. halys nymphs compared to the control, with specific concentrations for each gene targeted. However, when the same RNAs were topically delivered to both R. prolixus 2nd and 3rd instar nymphs, no gene silencing and mortality were observed. For this reason, to assess dsRNA application-mediated non-target effects, we injected both H. halys and R. prolixus specific dsRNA in R. prolixus 5th instar nymphs. When the dsRNA targeting H. halys IAP was microinjected into R. prolixus 5th instar nymphs, no mortality was observed, suggesting a strong RNAi specificity. Together, these data suggest that the topical delivery could be suitable for the dsRNA to control H. halys population.

Neurons expressing CePPEF include the ciliary chemosensory neurons AWB and AWC; and within these neurons, CePPEF is highly enriched in the sensory cilia. In transgenic C. elegans and in transfected 293 cells, CePPEF is membrane-associated, and the N terminus of CePPEF is necessary and sufficient for this membrane association. [(3)H]Myristate and [(3)H]palmitate labeling studies in 293 cells demonstrated that this association was mediated by myristoylation at Gly(2) and palmitoylation at Cys(3). Introducing the G2A or C3S mutation into CePPEF greatly reduced membrane association in 293 cells and in transgenic nematodes. A recombinant C-terminal fragment of CePPEF containing two putative EF-hands bound between one and two Ca(2+) ions/protein, and mutation of residues presumed to ligand calcium in the two putative EF-hands led to diminished calcium binding.

Pre-beta-HDLs were enriched in highly poly-unsaturated species of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine, and in an unexpectedly high number of proteins implicated in the inflammatory response, including serum paraoxonase/arylesterase-1, vitronectin and clusterin, as well as in complement regulation and immunity, including haptoglobin-related protein, complement proteins and those of the immunoglobulin class. Interestingly, amongst proteins associated with lipid metabolism, phospholipid transfer protein, cholesteryl ester transfer protein and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase were strongly enriched in, or restricted to, pre-beta-HDL. Furthermore, pre-beta-HDL potently mediated cellular cholesterol efflux and displayed strong anti-inflammatory activities. A correlational network analysis between lipidome, proteome and biological activities highlighted 15 individual lipid and protein components of pre-beta-HDL relevant to cardiovascular disease, which may constitute novel diagnostic targets in a pathological context of altered lipoprotein metabolism. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37639039/ """,

Group IVA was maintained with propofol and remifentanil, while Group CIA used sevoflurane, propofol, and remifentanil, with sevoflurane stopped after carotid exposure. Hemodynamics were controlled at various stages: ±10% before clamping, + 20% during clamping (metaraminol), and 0 to -10% after exposure.

To understand the biochemical shifts underlying PNH, this study aimed to search for the dysfunctional pathways involved in PNH physiopathology by comparing the systemic metabolic profiles of affected patients to healthy controls and the metabolomic profiles before and after the administration of eculizumab in PNH patients undergoing treatment. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37527257/ """,
""" 37527257: METHODS: Plasma metabolic profiles, comprising 186 specific annotated metabolites, were quantified using targeted quantitative electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in 23 PNH patients and 166 population-based controls.

These differences suggest altered acylcarnitine balance, reduction in the amino acids participating in the glycogenesis pathway and impaired glutaminolysis. In 12 PNH patients who were receiving regular eculizumab therapy, the concentrations of acylcarnitine C6:1, the C14:1/C6 ratio (reflecting the impaired action of the medium-chain acyl-Co A dehydrogenase), and the C4/C6 ratio (reflecting the impaired action of short-chain acyl-Co A dehydrogenase) were significantly reduced immediately before eculizumab infusion, revealing impairments in the Acyl CoA metabolism, and reached levels similar to those in the healthy controls 24 hours after infusion. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37527257/ """,

""" 31133529: Branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism occurs within the mitochondrial matrix and is comprised of multiple enzymes, some shared, organized into three pathways for the catabolism of leucine, isoleucine, and valine (LEU, ILE, and VAL respectively). Three different acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are active in each catabolic pathway and genetic deficiencies in each have been identified. While characteristic metabolites related to the enzymatic block accumulate in each deficiency, for reasons that are not clear, clinical symptoms are only seen in the context of deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVDH) in the leucine pathway. Metabolism of fibroblasts derived from patients with mutations in each of the BCAA ACADs were characterized using metabolomics to better understand the flux of BCAA through their respective pathways. Stable isotope labeled LEU, ILE, and VAL in patient and control cell lines revealed that mutations in isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBDH in the valine pathway) lead to a significant increase in isobutyrylcarnitine (a surrogate for the enzyme substrate isobutyryl-CoA) leading to metabolism by short-branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCADH in the isoleucine pathway) and production of the pathway end product propionylcarnitine (a surrogate for propionyl-CoA). Similar cross activity was observed for SBCADH deficient patient cells, leading to a significant increase in propionylcarnitine, presumably by metabolism of 2 methylbutyryl-CoA via IBDH activity. Labeled BCAA studies identified that the majority of the intracellular propionyl-CoA pool in fibroblasts is generated from isoleucine, but heptanoic acid (a surrogate for odd-chain fatty acids) is also efficiently converted to propionate. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31133529/ """,
""" 37205763: Sialic acids linked to glycoproteins and glycolipids are important mediators of cell and protein recognition events. These sugar residues are removed by neuraminidases (sialidases). Neuraminidase-1 (sialidase-1 or NEU1) is a ubiquitously expressed mammalian sialidase located in lysosomes and on the cell membrane. Because of its modulation of multiple signaling processes, it is a potential therapeutic target for cancers and immune disorders. Genetic defects in NEU1 or in its protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA, CTSA) cause the lysosomal storage diseases sialidosis and galactosialidosis. To further our understanding of this enzyme's function at the molecular level, we determined the three-dimensional structure of murine NEU1. The enzyme oligomerizes through two self-association interfaces and displays a wide substrate-binding cavity. A catalytic loop adopts an inactive conformation. We propose a mechanism of activation involving a conformational change in this loop upon binding to its protective protein. These findings may facilitate the development of selective inhibitor and agonist therapies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37205763/ """,

""" 35682772: Coronary reperfusion strategies are life-saving approaches to restore blood flow to cardiac tissue after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the sudden restoration of normal blood flow leads to ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI), which results in cardiomyoblast death, irreversible tissue degeneration, and heart failure. The molecular mechanism of IRI is not fully understood, and there are no effective cardioprotective strategies to prevent it. In this study, we show that activation of sialidase-3, a glycohydrolytic enzyme that cleaves sialic acid residues from glycoconjugates, is cardioprotective by triggering RISK pro-survival signaling pathways. We found that overexpression of Neu3 significantly increased cardiomyoblast resistance to IRI through activation of HIF-1α and Akt/Erk signaling pathways. This raises the possibility of using Sialidase-3 activation as a cardioprotective reperfusion strategy after myocardial infarction. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35682772/ """,
""" 39565596: Secretory proteins are critically dependent on the correct processing of their signal sequence by the signal peptidase complex (SPC). This step, which is essential for the proper folding and localization of proteins in eukaryotic cells, is still not fully understood. In eukaryotes, the SPC comprises four evolutionarily conserved membrane subunits (Spc1-3 and Sec11). Here, we investigated the role of Spc2, examining SPC cleavage efficiency on various models and natural signal sequences in yeast cells depleted of or with mutations in Spc2. Our data show that discrimination between substrates and identification of the cleavage site by SPC is compromised when Spc2 is absent or mutated. Molecular dynamics simulation of the yeast SPC AlphaFold2-Multimer model indicates that membrane thinning at the center of SPC is reduced without Spc2, suggesting a molecular explanation for the altered substrate recognition properties of SPC lacking Spc2. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which SPC governs protein biogenesis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39565596/ """,
