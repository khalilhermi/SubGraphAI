""" 39937310: Microsomal cytochromes P450 (micCYPs) are monooxygenases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and other endomembranes of human cells. micCYPs receive electrons from specific redox partners and perform enzymatic transformations of drugs and different endogenous substrates. The large biodiversity of micCYPs leads to the idea that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving micCYPs are not limited to classical redox partners. This review aims to perform a systems biology analysis of the complete set of PPIs for all 33 micCYPs studied, as well as to examine the subinteractome of each micCYP. We have retrieved 287 PPIs from interactomic databases, involving 246 unique protein interactors that share a similar profile of subcellular localization with micCYPs. The number of protein interactors per micCYP unevenly varies from one to 47. Interactors of micCYPs are involved in cellular metabolism, signal transduction, cell-cell junctions, cytoskeleton organization, and intracellular or transmembrane transport. Notably, up to one-third of all interactors belong to the latter group, half of which consists of membrane transporters of compounds, metabolites, and ions (e.g., CACNA2D1, ORAI1, SCN3B, SLC7A2, SLC19A3, and SLC11A2). The CYP2C8 subinteractome is enriched with proteins involved in autophagy; CYP2S1- ERBB2 and EPH-Ephrin signaling; CYP3A4- glucuronidation. Proteins UBC, PGRMC1, and FANCG are the most frequent common interactors across various micCYPs. Nine and 12 interactors of micCYPs are involved in phosphorylation and ubiquitination, respectively; 20 interactors are 'moonlighting' proteins that are represented in the CYP3A4 subinteractome. Furthermore, micCYPs such as CYP2C9, 3A5, 2E1, 2A6, 4F2, and 4A11 may be involved in potentially binary interactions with other micCYPs. The functional implication of these CYP-CYP pairs is likely associated with modulation of their activity. Analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that some micCYP/interactor pairs exhibit tissue-, time-, and disease-specific gene expression patterns. Drugs that are metabolized by micCYPs in some cases can influence the expression of corresponding interactors at the gene or protein levels. These findings suggest that micCYPs may play roles in functions beyond their monooxygenase activity, as indicated by the spectrum of PPIs analyzed. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937310/ """,
""" 38602333: A growing body of literature has linked early-life exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) with adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Once in the body, metabolism serves as a powerful mediator of PAH toxicity by bioactivating and detoxifying PAH metabolites. Since enzyme expression and activity vary considerably throughout human development, we evaluated infant metabolism of PAHs as a potential contributing factor to PAH susceptibility. We measured and compared rates of phenanthrene and retene (two primary PAH constituents of woodsmoke) metabolism in human hepatic microsomes from individuals ≤21 months of age to a pooled sample (n = 200) consisting primarily of adults. We used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to characterize cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) in the same hepatic microsome samples. Once incubated in microsomes, phenanthrene demonstrated rapid depletion. Best-fit models for phenanthrene metabolism demonstrated either 1 or 2 phases, depending on the sample, indicating that multiple enzymes could metabolize phenanthrene. We observed no statistically significant differences in phenanthrene metabolism as a function of age, although samples from the youngest individuals had the slowest phenanthrene metabolism rates. We observed slower rates of retene metabolism compared with phenanthrene also in multiple phases. Rates of retene metabolism increased in an age-dependent manner until adult (pooled) metabolism rates were achieved at ∼12 months. ABPP identified 28 unique CYPs among all samples, and we observed lower amounts of active CYPs in individuals ≤21 months of age compared to the pooled sample. Phenanthrene metabolism correlated to CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2C8, 4A22, 3A4, and 3A43 and retene metabolism correlated to CYPs 1A1, 1A2, and 2C8 measured by ABPP and vendor-supplied substrate marker activities. These results will aid efforts to determine human health risk and susceptibility to PAHs exposure during early life. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38602333/ """,
""" 37994244: As a synthetic androgen, 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) is widely used in aquaculture to induce sex reversal and may pose a potential risk to aquatic organisms. This ecological risk has attracted the attention of many scholars, but it is not comprehensive enough. Thus, the adverse effects of MT on zebrafish (Danio rerio) were comprehensively evaluated from gonadal histology, as well as the mRNA expression levels of 47 genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, germ cell differentiation, sex determination, and hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Adult zebrafish with a female/male ratio of 5:7 were exposed to a solvent control (0.001% dimethyl sulfoxide) and three measured concentrations of MT (5, 51 and 583 ng/L) for 50 days. The results showed that MT had no significant histological effects on the ovaries of females, but the frequency of late-mature oocytes (LMO) showed a downward trend, indicating that MT could induce ovarian suppression to a certain extent. The transcriptional expression of activating transcription factor 4b1 (atf4b1), activating transcription factor 4b2 (atf4b2), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta 1 (camk2d1), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta 2 (camk2d2) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 2 (camk2n2) genes in the brain of females increased significantly at all treatment groups of MT, and the mRNA expression of forkhead box L2a (foxl2) and ovarian cytochrome P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a) genes in the ovaries were down-regulated by 5 and 583 ng/L group, which would translate into inhibition of oocyte development. As compared to females, MT had relatively little effects on the reproductive system of males, and only the transcriptional alterations of synaptonemal complex protein 3 (sycp3) and 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (cyp17) genes were observed in the testes, not enough to affect testicular histology. In addition, MT at all treatments strongly increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) transcript in the brain of females, as well as deiodinase 2 (dio2) transcript in the brain of males. The paired box protein 8 (pax8) gene was significantly decreased at 51 or 583 ng/L of MT in both female and male brains. The above results suggest that MT can pose potential adverse effects on the reproductive and thyroid endocrine system of fish. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37994244/ """,

""" 39284705: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily represents the major drug-metabolizing enzymes responsible for metabolizing over 65% of therapeutic drugs, including those for pediatric use. CYP-ontogeny based physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling has emerged as useful approach to mechanistically extrapolate adult pharmacokinetic data to children. However, these models integrate physiological differences in the pediatric population including age-dependent differences in the abundances of CYP enzymes. Conventionally, developmental changes in CYP enzymes have been reported using protein abundance and activity data from subcellular fractions such as microsomes, which are prone to high technical variability. Similarly, the available pediatric pharmacokinetic data suffer from the lack of specific CYP substrates, especially in younger children. In the present study, we used viable hepatocytes from 50 pediatric (age, 1 day-18 years) and 8 adult human donors and carried out global proteomics-based quantification of all major hepatic CYP enzymes, including orphan enzymes that have not been studied previously. While CYPs 2B6, 3A5, 4A11, 4F3, and 4V2 did not show a significant association with age, all other quantified isoforms either increased or decreased with age. CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 2C18, and 2C19 were absent or barely detected in the neonatal group, while CYP3A7 was the highest in this group. The >1 to 2 years age group showed the highest total abundance of all CYP enzymes. The age-dependent differences in CYP enzymes reported in this study can be used to develop ontogeny-based PBPK models, which in turn can help improve pediatric dose prediction based on adult dosing, leading to safer drug pharmacology in children. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We quantified the age-dependent differences in the abundances of hepatic CYP enzymes using a large set of viable pediatric and adult hepatocytes using quantitative global proteomics. We report for the first time the ontogeny in the abundance of CYP enzymes in human hepatocytes, especially, orphan CYPs 20A1, 27A1, 51A1, 7B1, and 8B1 and CYP4 subfamily of enzymes.

Gut microbiota metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were determined by HPLC. The serum levels of myocardial enzymes (creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase-MB and lactate dehydrogenase) and the production of M1 factors (TNF-α and IL-1β) were measured by ELISA. The colonic macrophage phenotype was measured by mmunofluorescence and qPCR. The expression of Claudin-1, Occludin, ZO-1 and p-p65 was measured by western blot. The gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4X1 was determined using qPCR.

Fecal microbiota transplantation mirrored the effect of BMS-1 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiotoxicity, while macrophage depletion and neutralization of TNF-α and IL-1β greatly attenuated BMS-1-induced cardiotoxicity. Importantly, Prevotella loescheii recolonization and butyrate supplementation alleviated PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-related cardiotoxicity. Mechanistically, gut microbiota dysbiosis promoted M1-like polarization of colonic macrophages and the production of proinflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β through downregulation of PPARα-CYP4X1 axis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980222/ """,

""" 38604728: Cytochrome P450 (CYP)4Z1, a highly expressed CYP gene in breast cancer, was one of the last CYPs to be identified in the human genome, some 20 years ago. CYP4 enzymes typically catalyze ω-hydroxylation and metabolize ω3 and ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids to bioactive lipid metabolites that can influence tumor growth and metastasis. These attributes of CYP4Z1 make it an attractive target for new chemotherapeutic drug design, as a potential biomarker for selection of patients that might respond favorably to drugs and for developing enzyme inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the advancing biochemistry of CYP4Z1, its role in breast cancer, and the recent synthesis of selective chemical inhibitors of the enzyme. We identify gaps that need to be filled to further advance this field and present new experimental data on recombinant CYP4Z1 expression and purification of the active catalytic form. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In breast cancer, an unmet need is the availability of highly effective therapeutic agents, especially for triple negative breast cancer. The relevance of the work summarized in this mini-review is that it identifies a new potential drug target, CYP4Z1, and discusses ways in which the gene product's catalytic activity might be modulated in order to combat this malignancy and limit its spread. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38604728/ """,
""" 39885913: Dendrobium nobile Lindl. alkaloids (DNLA) are active ingredients that can be extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Dendrobium Nobile Lindl. DNLA exhibits hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemia effects. However, to the best of our knowledge, the specific molecular mechanism by which DNLA can regulate lipid metabolism remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of DNLA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells and its potential mechanism. HepG2 cells were treated with LPS with or without different concentrations of DNLA (0, 0.035, 0.35 and 3.5 µg/ml) for 48 h. Cell viability was then detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanideperchlorate-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake assay was used to examine LDL uptake. In addition, possible mechanisms were explored using western blot analysis. The effect of the combination of DNLA with rosuvastatin calcium on the expression levels of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) was examined. The results indicated that LPS stimulation reduced the uptake of LDL by HepG2 cells, decreased the intracellular LDLR content, and increased the expression levels of inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL) and liver X receptor (LXR)α. DNLA intervention reversed all of the aforementioned LPS-induced effects in HepG2 cells. Additional mechanistic experiments revealed that DNLA exerted its effects mainly by regulating the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway. It was shown that DNLA also reduced the expression levels of PCSK9, sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α. In addition, DNLA decreased the expression levels of PCSK9 in rosuvastatin calcium-induced HepG2 cells. Notably, DNLA was able to decrease 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and increase cytochrome p450 7A1 expression at the protein level, which are rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. Collectively, these data suggested that DNLA could enhance LDL uptake of HepG2 cells by increasing LDLR expression through the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway to alleviate the effects induced by LPS, suggesting the potential benefit of DNLA in improving lipid metabolism disorders. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39885913/ """,

""" 39766190: Mitochondrial holocytochrome c synthase (HCCS) is an essential protein in assembling cytochrome c (cyt c) of the electron transport system. HCCS binds heme and covalently attaches the two vinyls of heme to two cysteine thiols of the cyt c CXXCH motif. Human HCCS recognizes both cyt c and cytochrome c<sub>1</sub> of complex III (cytochrome bc<sub>1</sub>). HCCS is mutated in some human diseases and it has been investigated recombinantly by mutational, biochemical, and reconstitution studies in the past decade. Here, we employ structural prediction programs (e.g., AlphaFold 3) on HCCS and its two substrates, heme and cytochrome c. The results, when combined with spectroscopic and functional analyses of HCCS and variants, provide insights into the structural basis for heme binding, apocyt c binding, covalent attachment, and release of the holocyt c product. Results from in vitro reconstitution of purified human HCCS using cyt c and cyt c<sub>1</sub> peptides as acceptors are consistent with the structural modeling of substrate binding. Reconstitution of HCCS and cyt c<sub>1</sub> provides an approach to studying cyt c<sub>1</sub> assembly, which has been refractile to recombinant in vivo reconstitution (unlike HCCS and cyt c). We propose a structural basis for release of the holocyt c product from HCCS based on in vitro studies and on cryoEM structures of the bacterial cyt c synthase (CcsBA) active site. We analyze the kinetoplastid mitochondrial synthase (KCCS), and hypothesize a molecular evolutionary path from mitochondrial endosymbiosis to the current HCCS. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39766190/ """,
""" 31642192: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) are major contributors to angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis through the binding of VEGF ligands. We have previously shown that the bone marrow tyrosine kinase BMX is critical for inflammatory angiogenesis via its direct transactivation of VEGFR2. In the present study, we show that siRNA-mediated silencing of BMX led to a significant decrease in the total levels of VEGFR2 mRNA and protein, without affecting their stability, in human endothelial cells (ECs). Interestingly, BMX was detected in the nuclei of ECs, and the SH3 domain of BMX was necessary for its nuclear localization. Luciferase assays showed a significant decrease in the Vegfr2 (kdr) gene promoter activity in ECs after BMX silencing, indicating that BMX is necessary for Vegfr2 transcription. In addition, we found that wild-type BMX, but not a catalytic inactive mutant BMX-K445R, promoted Vegfr2 promoter activity and VEGF-induced EC migration and tube sprouting. Mechanistically, we show that the enhancement of Vegfr2 promoter activity by BMX was mediated by Sp1, a transcription factor critical for the Vegfr2 promoter. Loss of BMX significantly reduced Sp1 binding to the Vegfr2 promoter as assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Wild-type BMX, but not a kinase-inactive form of BMX, associated with and potentially phosphorylated Sp1. Moreover, a nuclear-targeted BMX (NLS-BMX), but not cytoplasm-localized form (NES-BMX), bound to Sp1 and augmented VEGFR2 expression. In conclusion, we uncovered a novel function of nuclear-localized BMX in regulating VEGFR2 expression and angiogenesis, suggesting that BMX is a therapeutic target for angiogenesis-related diseases. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31642192/ """,

A total of 11 concussed male athletes were enrolled at our academic Sport Medicine Concussion Clinic, as well as 24 sex-, age- and activity-matched healthy control subjects. Clinical evaluation was performed and blood was drawn within 72 h of injury. Proximity extension assays were performed for 1,472 plasma proteins; a total of six proteins were considered significantly different between cohorts (P &lt; 0.01; five proteins decreased and one protein increased). Receiver operating characteristic curves on the six individual protein biomarkers identified had areas-under-the-curves (AUCs) for concussion diagnosis ≥0.78; antioxidant 1 copper chaperone (ATOX1; AUC 0.81, P = 0.003), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC; AUC 0.81, P = 0.004), cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34; AUC 0.79, P = 0.006), polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1; AUC 0.78, P = 0.008), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-like 1 (IGFBPL1; AUC 0.78, P = 0.008) and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 3A (NT5C3A; AUC 0.78, P = 0.009). Combining three of the protein biomarkers (ATOX1, SPARC and NT5C3A), produced an AUC of 0.98 for concussion diagnoses (P &lt; 0.001; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). Despite a paucity of studies on these three identified proteins, the available evidence points to their roles in modulating tissue inflammation and regulating integrity of the cerebral microvasculature. Taken together, our exploratory data suggest that three or less novel proteins, which are amenable to a point-of-care immunoassay, may be future candidate biomarkers for screening adolescent sport concussion.

""" 39769034: Cognitive impairment is a core feature of neurodevelopmental (schizophrenia) and aging-associated (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia) neurodegenerative diseases. Limited efficacy of current pharmacological treatments warrants further search for new targets for nootropic interventions. The breakdown of myelin, a phospholipids axonal sheath that protects the conduction of nerve impulse between neurons, was proposed as a neuropathological abnormality that precedes and promotes the deposition of amyloid-β in neuritic plaques. The present review of the recent literature and our own pre- and clinical data suggest (for the first time) that the anthranilic acid (AA)-induced activation of microglial-expressed G-protein coupled receptor (GPR109A) inhibits cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), an enzyme that triggers the degradation of myelin and consequently attenuates cognitive impairment. The present review suggests that the up-regulation of AA formation is a sex-specific compensatory (adaptive) reaction aimed to prevent/treat cognitive impairment. The AA-GPR109A-cPLA2-myelin-cognition cascade suggests new nootropic interventions, e.g., the administration of pegylated kynureninase, an enzyme that catalyzes AA formation from Kynurenine (Kyn), a tryptophane catabolite; pegylated interferon-alpha; central and peripheral Kyn aminotransferase inhibitors that increase availability of Kyn as a substrate for AA formation; and vagus nerve stimulation. The cascade predicts nootropic activity of exogenous GPR109A agonists that were designed and underwent clinical trials (unsuccessful) as anti-dyslipidemia agents. The proposed cascade might contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Data on AA in neurodegenerative disorders are scarce, and the proposed cascade needs further exploration in pre- and clinical studies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39769034/ """,

Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of purine nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes has emerged as a potential strategy for treating diseases. We previously showed that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (NT5C2)-deficient mice were protected against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance. This study investigated effects of dual deletion of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidases IA (NT5C1A) and II (NT5C2) in mice. We found that NT5C1A/NT5C2 double-knockout (NT5C-dKO) mice exhibited mild hypoglycemia, associated with enhanced skeletal muscle insulin action and reduced hepatic glucose production. This phenotype was accompanied by liver and skeletal muscle proteomic alterations notably related to amino acid metabolism, besides potential involvement of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

""" 39929584: D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) is a flavin-dependent peroxisomal monooxygenase with a substrate preference for glycine and certain small hydrophobic D-amino acids. Although the biochemical properties of the enzyme have been extensively studied since 1930s, the therapeutic interest in targeting the enzyme emerged more recently after the physiological significance of endogenous D-serine, a substrate for DAAO, was recognized in 1990s. This triggered a new wave of efforts by many researchers to develop more potent and drug-like DAAO inhibitors with greater translational potential. This chapter recounts the evolution of DAAO inhibitors since then driven by new molecular design strategies guided by structural biology. Some of these inhibitors were investigated in a range of preclinical in vivo studies to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and behavioral pharmacology. Most importantly, these efforts culminated with the discovery of TAK-831 (luvadaxistat), an orally available brain-penetrant DAAO inhibitor currently under clinical development, representing a true bench-to-bedside success in this field. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39929584/ """,
""" 39512202: Mitophagy, the process by which cells eliminate damaged mitochondria, is mediated by PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1). Our recent research indicates that PINK1 functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by regulating cellular metabolism. Interestingly, PINK1 ablation activated the NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome, releasing IL1B (interleukin 1 beta). However, inhibiting the NLRP3-IL1B signaling pathway with an IL1R (interleukin 1 receptor) antagonist or NLRP3 inhibitor did not hinder colon tumor growth after PINK1 loss. To identify druggable targets in PINK1-deficient tumors, ribonucleic acid sequencing analysis was performed on colon tumors from pink1 knockout and wild-type mice. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis highlighted the enrichment of iron ion transmembrane transporter activity. Subsequent qualitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed an increase in mitochondrial iron transporters, including mitochondrial calcium uniporter, in PINK1-deficient colon tumor cells and tissues. Live-cell iron staining demonstrated elevated cellular and mitochondrial iron levels in PINK1-deficient cells. Clinically used drugs deferiprone and minocycline reduced mitochondrial iron and superoxide levels, resulting in decreased colon tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Manipulating the mitochondrial iron uptake protein MCU (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) also affected cell and xenograft tumor growth.

""" 39955279: Accurate sister chromatid segregation requires remodeling chromosome architecture, decatenation, and attachment to the mitotic spindle. Some of these events are initiated during S-phase, but they accelerate and conclude during mitosis. Here we describe SRBD1 as a histone and nucleic acid binding protein that prevents DNA damage in interphase cells, localizes to nascent DNA during replication and the chromosome scaffold in mitosis, and is required for chromosome segregation. SRBD1 inactivation causes micronuclei, chromatin bridges, and cell death. Inactivating SRBD1 immediately prior to mitotic entry causes anaphase failure, with a reduction in topoisomerase IIα localization to mitotic chromosomes and defects in properly condensing and decatenating chromosomes. In contrast, SRBD1 is not required to complete cell division after chromosomes are condensed. Strikingly, depleting condensin II reduces the severity of the anaphase defects in SRBD1-deficient cells by restoring topoisomerase IIα localization. Thus, SRBD1 is an essential genome maintenance protein required for mitotic chromosome organization and segregation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955279/ """,

""" 38039951: Mitoxantrone (1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis[2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylamino]-anthracene-9,10-dione) is a clinically-relevant synthetic anthracenedione that functions as a topoisomerase II poison by trapping DNA double-strand break intermediates. Mitoxantrone binds to DNA via both stacking interactions with DNA bases and hydrogen bonding with the sugar-phosphate backbone. It has been shown that mitoxantrone inhibits apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 1 (APE1)-catalyzed incision of DNA containing a tetrahydrofuran (THF) moiety and more recently, that mitoxantrone forms Schiff base conjugates at AP sites in DNA. In this study, mitoxantrone-mediated inhibition of APE1 at THF sites was shown to be consistent with preferential binding to, and thermal stabilization of DNA containing a THF site as compared to non-damaged DNA. Investigations into the properties of mitoxantrone at AP and 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde sites demonstrated that in addition to being a potent inhibitor of APE1 at these biologically-relevant substrates (∼ 0.5 μM IC<sub>50</sub> on AP site-containing DNA), mitoxantrone also incised AP site-containing DNA by catalyzing β- and β/δ-elimination reactions. The efficiency of these reactions to generate the 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and 3' phosphate products was modulated by DNA structure. Although these cell-free reactions revealed that mitoxantrone can generate 3' phosphates, cells lacking polynucleotide kinase phosphatase did not show increased sensitivity to mitoxantrone treatment. Consistent with its ability to inhibit APE1 activity on DNAs containing either an AP site or a 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, combined exposures to clinically-relevant concentrations of mitoxantrone and a small molecule APE1 inhibitor revealed additive cytotoxicity. These data suggest that in a cellular context, mitoxantrone may interfere with APE1 DNA repair functions. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38039951/ """,

""" 39955407: Industrial manufacturing of liposomal drugs, often involves high-temperature processes, resulting in increased energy consumption, prolonged process times, and elevated costs, while posing risks of phospholipid and drug degradation. The current study addresses these challenges by exploring remote loading of doxorubicin into liposomes, at temperatures below the phase transition temperature (PTT) of the primary phospholipid (DSPC, 55 °C). Drug loading efficiencies exceeding 90% at 45 °C were achieved, while efficiencies dropped significantly (6-fold and 23-fold) at 37 °C and 25 °C, respectively. This prompted the hypothesis that efficient drug loading might be attained below the PTT, when a minimal threshold for liposomal membrane fluidity is overcome. Using design of experiments (DoE), key factors influencing fluidity were identified: temperature, cholesterol content and surface tension (dependent on the isotonic agent). A full factorial DoE confirmed that membrane fluidity increased with lower surface tension, and high cholesterol content. A predictive model was also generated establishing a correlation between drug loading efficiency, membrane fluidity, and drug partitioning coefficient (logP). This model revealed that doxorubicin (logP = 1.5) requires a fluidity threshold of 4.41 for efficient loading (≥ 90%), whereas daunorubicin (logP = 2.32) needs a lower threshold of 3.85, suggesting that drugs with higher logP values demand lower fluidity thresholds for effective loading. The model's applicability was validated across various lipid formulations, enabling effective drug loading at temperatures as low as 25 °C, potentially reducing degradation risks and energy costs. Overall, these findings highlight the relevance of liposomal membrane fluidity studies as a potential tool for enabling more effective industrial processes. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955407/ """,

This study investigated a patient affected by optic atrophy, ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy resulting from compound heterozygous mutations in FDXR. Structural abnormalities in mitochondria were observed in muscle and nerve tissues. Lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) and muscle samples from the patient exhibited signs of mitochondrial dysfunction, iron overload, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation. Dysregulation of the glutathione peroxidase-4 was noted in the LCLs.

""" 37286037: The everninomicins are bacterially produced antibiotic octasaccharides characterized by the presence of two interglycosidic spirocyclic ortho-δ-lactone (orthoester) moieties. The terminating G- and H-ring sugars, L-lyxose and C-4 branched sugar β-D-eurekanate, are proposed to be biosynthetically derived from nucleotide diphosphate pentose sugar pyranosides; however, the identity of these precursors and their biosynthetic origin remain to be determined. Herein we identify a new glucuronic acid decarboxylase from Micromonospora belonging to the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes, EvdS6. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that EvdS6 is an NAD+-dependent bifunctional enzyme that produces a mixture of two products, differing in the sugar C-4 oxidation state. This product distribution is atypical for glucuronic acid decarboxylating enzymes, most of which favor production of the reduced sugar and a minority of which favor release of the oxidized product. Spectroscopic and stereochemical analysis of reaction products revealed that the first product released is the oxidatively produced 4-keto-D-xylose and the second product is the reduced D-xylose. X-ray crystallographic analysis of EvdS6 at 1.51 Å resolution with bound co-factor and TDP demonstrated that the overall geometry of the EvdS6 active site is conserved with other SDR enzymes and enabled studies probing structural determinants for the reductive half of the net neutral catalytic cycle. Critical active site threonine and aspartate residues were unambiguously identified as essential in the reductive step of the reaction and resulted in enzyme variants producing almost exclusively the keto sugar.

It is well known that metastasis establishment, cell survival, and progression are affected by tumour-host cell interactions where changes in the host cellular compartments likely play an important role. In this context, miRNAs transferred by tumour derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have previously been shown to create a favourable tumour microenvironment. Here, we show that miR-146a-5p is highly expressed in human melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) EVs, both in MBM cell lines as well as in biopsies, thereby modulating the brain metastatic niche. Mechanistically, miR-146a-5p was transferred to astrocytes via EV delivery and inhibited NUMB in the Notch signalling pathway. This resulted in activation of tumour-promoting cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and CXCL1). Brain metastases were significantly reduced following miR-146a-5p knockdown. Corroborating these findings, miR-146a-5p inhibition led to a reduction of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and CXCL1 in astrocytes.

His hypoglycemia was managed with diazoxide, chlorothiazide, and monitoring via a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM). X-ray showed 3 metallic wire foreign bodies, consistent with retained Dexcom sensor wires. He was referred to surgery for foreign body removal. Intraoperative fluoroscopy revealed 4 pieces of wire. Two superficial pieces were removed, but 2 small pieces deep to the fascia remained because of significant risk of injury or bleeding if removal was attempted.

""" 38580011: Human carbonic anhydrases (hCAs) play a central role in various physiological processes in the human body. HCAs catalyze the reversible hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> into HCO<sub>3</sub>-, and hence maintains the fluid and pH balance. Overexpression of CA II is associated with diseases, such as glaucoma, and epilepsy. Therefore, CAs are important clinical targets and inhibition of different isoforms, especially hCA II is used in treatment of glaucoma, altitude sickness, and epilepsy. Therapeutically used CA inhibitors (CAI) are sulfonamide-based, such as acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, etc. However, they exhibit several undesirable effects such as numbness, tingling of extremities, malaise, metallic taste, fatigue, renal calculi, and metabolic acidosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify safe and effective inhibitors of the hCAs. In this study, different phenyl boronic acids 1-5 were evaluated against bovine (bCA II) and hCA II. Among all, compound 1 (4-acetylphenyl boronic acid) was found to be active against bCAII and hCA II with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 246 ± 0.48 and 281.40 ± 2.8 μM, respectively, while the remaining compounds were found in-active. Compound 1 was identified as competitive inhibitor of hCA II enzyme (K<sub>i</sub> = 283.7 ± 0.002 μM). Additionally, compound 1 was found to be non-toxic against BJ Human fibroblast cell line. The X-ray crystal structure for hCA II in-complex with compound 1 was evaluated to a resolution of 2.6 Å. In fact, this the first structural analysis of a phenyl boron-based inhibitor bound to hCA II, allowing an additional structure-activity analysis of the compounds. Compound 1 was found to be directly bound in the active site of hCA II by interacting with His94, His119, and Thr199 residues. In addition, a bond of 3.11 Å between the zinc ion and coordinated boron atom of the boronic acid moiety of compound 1 was also observed, contributing to binding affinity of compound 1 for hCA II.

""" 39870236: Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) plays a crucial role in cancer cell metabolism by regulating the glycolytic pathway. Although, inhibitors targeting PDK1 have been effective in inhibiting glycolysis in multiple cancers, their lack of selectivity leading to off-target effects limit their therapeutic benefit. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory potential of six PDK1 inhibitors on cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion of androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-negative PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Of the six PDK1 inhibitors, radicicol and dicumarol significantly inhibited cellular proliferation and exhibited lower metabolic activity in both LNCaP and PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer cells. Radicicol was highly effective at lower concentration. Moreover, radicicol significantly inhibited migration and invasion in PC-3 cells. We then developed a lactoferrin nanoparticle (LF-NP) encapsulated with Radicicol (Ra-LF-NP), using a rotary evaporation method. Spheroid assays confirmed the higher inhibitory potential of Ra-LF-NP with a reduction in spheroid area by 80%, and invasiveness compared to radicicol alone. Lactoferrin receptors are overexpressed on the surface of many cancer cells, including prostate cancer. Conjugating radicicol with lactoferrin nanoparticles, potentially enhanced the specific uptake of the drug by prostate cancer cells while minimizing the off-target effects on healthy cells. This targeted therapy approach could lead to improved treatment outcomes and reduced side effects. Our study demonstrated the potential of radicicol delivery by lactoferrin-conjugated nanoparticle as an efficient drug delivery strategy for prostate cancer treatment. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39870236/ """,

Overall health effects of GEN and DAI in humans exhibit a dual nature, presenting both health benefits and concerns related to their interaction with the estrogen receptor. The metabolomes of these isoflavones were determined in 28-day oral studies in male and female Wistar rats to elucidate (1) metabolites changes, (2) compare their metabolomes with other compounds and (3) identify toxicological modes of action (MoA). Dose levels for GEN were 1000 and 300 mg/kg bw by gavage and 1000 and 300 ppm (via diet). DAI gavage dose levels were 1000 and 100 mg/kg bw. Results were evaluated using the MetaMap®Tox data base. Both compounds demonstrated metabolome profiles which were associated with estrogenic profiles and compounds, predominantly in females. However, the metabolomes were compound specific with relatively few common metabolite changes. There were no relevant matches between any GEN and any DAI treatment group indicating that both compounds are substantially different from metabolome perspective. Ranking of the metabolome patters for GEN and DAI with ≥ 1000 compounds in the MetaMap®Tox database revealed correlations with estrogenic and other hormonally active compounds. GEN-treated females correlated best with Cabergoline, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, DAI females with tamoxifen and diethylstilbestrol, suggesting that even their estrogenic activity may be different. Beyond estrogenic effects, the high dose (HD) DAI metabolome indicated altered fatty acid metabolism associated with PPAR-alpha activation. For GEN, there was an indication of ethanolamine-like liver effects. Dose levels without estrogenic effects for GEN were 1000 and 100 mg/kg bw for males and females respectively, there were no estrogenic effects in the feeding studies. For DAI males, the no estrogenic effect level was 300 mg/kg bw, for females &lt; 100 mg/kg bw, suggesting that DAI may be a more potent estrogen than GEN in rats. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954026/ """,

""" 39950957: Enzymes play crucial roles in all biological systems by catalyzing a myriad of chemical reactions. These reactions range from simple one-step processes to intricate multistep cascades. Predicting mechanistically appropriate binding modes along a reaction pathway for substrate, product, and all reaction intermediates and transition states is a daunting task. To address this challenge, special docking programs like EnzyDock have been developed. Yet, running such docking simulations is complicated due to the nature of multistep enzyme processes. This work presents CHARMM-GUI EnzyDocker, a web-based cyberinfrastructure designed to streamline the preparation and running of EnzyDock docking simulations. The development of EnzyDocker has been achieved through integration of existing CHARMM-GUI modules, such as PDB Reader and Manipulator, Ligand Designer, and QM/MM Interfacer. In addition, new functionalities have been developed to facilitate a one-stop preparation of multistate and multiscale docking systems and enable interactive and intuitive ligand modifications and flexible protein residues selections. A simple setup related to multiligand docking is automatized through intuitive user interfaces. EnzyDocker offers support for standard classical docking and QM/MM docking with CHARMM built-in semiempirical engines. Automated consensus restraints for incorporating experimental knowledge into the docking are facilitated via a maximum common substructure algorithm. To illustrate the robustness of EnzyDocker, we conducted docking simulations of three enzyme systems: dihydrofolate reductase, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and the diterpene synthase CotB2. In addition, we have created four tutorial videos about these systems, which can be found at https://www.charmm-gui.org/demo/enzydock.

""" 39938808: The emergence of new human viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential has reaffirmed the urgency to develop effective broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAs) as part of a strategic framework for pandemic prevention and preparedness. To this end, the host nucleotide metabolic pathway has been subject to intense investigation in the search for host-targeting agents (HTAs) with potential BSA activity. In particular, human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH), a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, has been identified as a preferential target of new HTAs. Viral replication in fact relies on cellular pyrimidine replenishment, making hDHODH an ideal HTA target. The depletion of the host pyrimidine pool that ensues the pharmacological inhibition of hDHODH activity elicits effective BSA activity through three distinct mechanisms: it blocks viral DNA and RNA synthesis; it activates effector mechanisms of the host innate antiviral response; and it mitigates the virus-induced inflammatory response. However, despite the spectacular results obtained in vitro, the hDHODH inhibitors examined as mono-drug therapies in animal models of human viral infections and in clinical trials have produced disappointing levels of overall antiviral efficacy. To overcome this inherent limitation, pharmacological strategies based on multi-drug combination treatments should be considered to enable efficacy of hDHODH-targeted antiviral therapies. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of antiviral applications of hDHODH inhibitors, discuss the challenges that have emerged from their testing in animal models and human clinical trials and consider how they might be addressed to advance the development of hDHODH inhibitors as BSA for the treatment of viral diseases. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39938808/ """,

""" 39816548: Dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1), initially identified as a renal membrane enzyme in mature human kidneys, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. It facilitates the exchange of materials and signal transduction across cell membranes, contributing significantly to dipeptide hydrolysis, glucose and lipid metabolism, immune inflammation, and ferroptosis, among other cellular functions. Extensive research has delineated the complex role of DPEP1 in oncogenesis and tumor progression, with its influence being context dependent. DPEP1 has been observed to promote oncogenic activities in hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and lymphoblastic malignancies and is hypothesized to participate in multiple biological processes, including tumor cell invasion, metastatic spread, cellular signaling pathways, cell-matrix interactions, and evasion of immune surveillance. Conversely, DPEP1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lobular breast carcinoma, and Wilms tumor. Moreover, the role of DPEP1 in colorectal cancer has been increasingly recognized in recent research. Emerging evidence suggests that DPEP1 substantially augments the metastatic and invasive potential of colorectal cancer cells, facilitates immune evasion, and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Despite these findings, the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be fully characterized. This systematic review endeavors to elucidate the structural and functional attributes of the DPEP1 protein, with the aim to clarify its regulatory mechanisms and assess its clinical relevance in oncology. Gaining a thorough understanding of the physiological role and molecular underpinnings of DPEP1 is critical to informing the diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic paradigms of related pathologies.
