""" 39809159: The journey of bone repair is a lengthy process. Traditionally, oral or topical medications have been employed to facilitate healing, approaches that are not only costly but may also lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal damage. With advancements in electrophysiology, the significance of bioelectric activity in tissue repair has become increasingly prominent, thereby enhancing the focus on research into electroacupuncture (EA) for bone repair. EA, a synthesis of traditional acupuncture and electrical stimulation, can regulate pain by inhibiting the transmission of electrical signals, reducing the expression of ion channel proteins, and promoting the release of neurotransmitters at targeted sites. Moreover, EA has the capability to influence macrophage polarization and modulate inflammatory cytokines, aiding in bone repair. Additionally, EA has the potential to regulate cytokines such as Ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EphB4), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Erythropoietin (EPO), and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP-2), thus promoting angiogenesis and fracture healing.This paper explores the mechanisms by which EA facilitates bone healing and assesses its advantages and limitations in clinical applications. It offers a theoretical foundation for the safe, effective, and rational use of EA, presenting a novel approach for enhancing bone regeneration. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39809159/ """,

We previously identified a secretory protein (260/280KDa oligomers) of hamster cauda epididymal principal cells that binds to nonviable sperm. The 260/280KDa oligomers are composed of 64kDa FGL2 (fibrinogen-like protein-2) and 33kDa FGL1) (fibrinogen-like protein-1). The potential mechanism by which FGL2 binds to degenerative sperm is not clearly demonstrated. In this study, we report the downstream sequence of prothrombinase activity of FGL2, the identification of organelles, and characterize candidate proteins that bind FGL2. The following reaction sequence confirms that FGL2 is a phospholipid-activated serine protease; the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by FGL2, followed by the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin polymers by thrombin. FGL2 binds intensely to tails than heads of de-membranated sperm. A spectrum of polypeptides of cauda sperm tails binds to FGL2. Proteomic analyses of 65KDa, 16kDa, and 13kDa polypeptides of tails correspond to a-Kinase anchor protein 4, glutathione peroxidase 4, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4, respectively.

""" 39900894: Highly myopic cataract (HMC) is a leading cause of blindness among the working-age individuals, with its pathogenesis poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the role of ferroptosis in HMC development as well as the underlying mechanisms. In HMC lens epithelia, levels of Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation were found elevated, with increased vulnerability towards ferroptosis as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing of HMC lens epithelial samples identified up-regulated expression of discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2) as a key factor, which could enhance ferroptosis sensitivity via the Src-Hippo pathway. Specifically, DDR2 interacted with Src kinase, leading to the nuclear translocation of homologous transcriptional regulators (yes-associated protein 1 [YAP1] and WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 [WWTR1]) of the Hippo pathway, which altered the expression level of ferroptosis-related genes. Notably, highly myopic eyes of mice exhibited higher sensitivity to RSL3, a ferroptosis inducer, manifested as more severe nuclear lens opacities both in vitro and in vivo compared with the contralateral control eyes, which could be alleviated by inhibitors of either ferroptosis or DDR2. Altogether, these findings highlighted the role of DDR2 in mediating ferroptosis in HMC formation, providing a novel insight for therapeutic interventions. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39900894/ """,

We enrolled 27 adult patients with cardiovascular disease (64 ± 15 years) and 35 healthy volunteers (36.37 ± 12.29 years). We used a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method to measure 25(OH)D2/3 concentrations and their epimers. Plasma concentrations of 1α,25(OH)2D3 were determined by sensitive and quantitative enzyme immunoassay following intra- and inter-day validation. Vitamin D insufficiency was observed in approximately 52% of the patients and 37% of healthy volunteers. Comparable levels of 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 were seen in both groups. The observed levels of the epimeric form 3-epi-25(OH)D3 appeared approximately 1.7 times higher in healthy volunteers, accounting for 9% misclassified according to vitamin D status. Also, patients had lower concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3, and their 3-epi-25(OH)D2 levels were below the detection limit (2 ng/mL). In all studied subjects, 25(OH)D3 was negatively correlated with % 3-epi-25(OH)D3 (R=-0.758; P<0.001), and 3-epi-25(OH)D2 was negatively correlated with % 3-epi-25(OH)D2 (R = -0.842; P = 0.002).

""" 38409325: Cellular senescence affects many physiological and pathological processes and is characterized by durable cell cycle arrest, an inflammatory secretory phenotype and metabolic reprogramming. Here, by using dynamic transcriptome and metabolome profiling in human fibroblasts with different subtypes of senescence, we show that a homoeostatic switch that results in glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) accumulation links lipid metabolism to the senescence gene expression programme. Mechanistically, p53-dependent glycerol kinase activation and post-translational inactivation of phosphate cytidylyltransferase 2, ethanolamine regulate this metabolic switch, which promotes triglyceride accumulation in lipid droplets and induces the senescence gene expression programme. Conversely, G3P phosphatase and ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase-based scavenging of G3P and pEtN acts in a senomorphic way by reducing G3P and pEtN accumulation. Collectively, our study ties G3P and pEtN accumulation to controlling lipid droplet biogenesis and phospholipid flux in senescent cells, providing a potential therapeutic avenue for targeting senescence and related pathophysiology. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38409325/ """,
""" 11901095: The reduction of the triple bond and carbonyl group of an alpha,beta-ketoalkyne, 4-phenyl-3-butyn-2-one (PBYO), by rat liver microsomes and cytosol was investigated.

The triple bond of 1-phenyl-1-butyne, deprenyl, ethynylestradiol, ethinamate, and PBYOL, in which the triple bond is not adjacent to a carbonyl group, were not reduced by liver microsomes even in the presence of NADPH. PBO was further reduced to 4-phenyl-2-butanone (PBA) by liver cytosol with NADPH. PBYOL was also formed from PBYO by liver cytosol in the presence of NADPH or NADH. The microsomal triple-bond reductase activity was inhibited by disulfiram, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid but not beta-diethylaminoethyldiphenylpropylacetate or carbon monoxide. The triple-bond reductase activity in liver microsomes was not enhanced by several inducers of the rat cytochrome P450 system. These results suggested that the triple-bond reduction is caused by a new type of reductase, not cytochrome P450. The microsomal and cytosolic carbonyl reductase activities were not inhibited by quercitrin, indomethacin, or phenobarbital. Only S-PBYOL was formed from PBYO by liver cytosol. In contrast, liver microsomes produced R-PBYOL together with the S-enantiomer to some extent. Ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase activity in rat liver microsomes was markedly inhibited by PBYO and PBO, partly by PBYOL, but not by PBA. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11901095/ """,

""" 33397209: Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) responsible for viral pneumonia which emerged in late 2019 has badly affected the world. No clinically proven drugs are available yet as the targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease. The viral main protease which helps in replication and transcription inside the host can be an effective drug target. In the present study, we aimed to discover the potential of β-adrenoceptor agonists and adenosine deaminase inhibitors which are used in asthma and cancer/inflammatory disorders, respectively, as repurposing drugs against protease inhibitor by ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening using COVID-19 protease-N3 complex. The AARRR pharmacophore model was used to screen a set of 22,621 molecules to obtain hits, which were subjected to high-throughput virtual screening. Extra precision docking identified four top-scored molecules such as +/--fenoterol, FR236913 and FR230513 with lower binding energy from both categories. Docking identified three major hydrogen bonds with Gly143, Glu166 and Gln189 residues. 100 ns MD simulation was performed for four top-scored molecules to analyze the stability, molecular mechanism and energy requirements. MM/PBSA energy calculation suggested that van der Waals and electrostatic energy components are the main reasons for the stability of complexes. Water-mediated hydrogen bonds between protein-ligand and flexibility of the ligand are found to be responsible for providing extra stability to the complexes. The insights gained from this combinatorial approach can be used to design more potent and bio-available protease inhibitors against novel coronavirus.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

""" 39928275: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their severe complications have posed immense challenges to global healthcare systems. A significant obstacle in this field lies in the development of innovative targets, mechanisms, and drugs to mitigate the side effects associated with current antiplatelet therapies. Through screening relevant CVD targets in the Gene Card database, we found that AhR appears to be linked to CVDs. Computer-aided drug screening and molecular docking techniques identified famciclovir as a potential AhR inhibitor. Further experiments demonstrated that famciclovir suppresses AhR expression and platelet activation in thrombin-stimulated platelets, significantly reducing mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress. Notably, oral administration of famciclovir significantly inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation without affecting coagulation factors or thrombolysis systems. Moreover, famciclovir mitigates FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced carotid arterial thrombosis and cerebral thrombosis induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Our study suggests that inhibiting AhR expression with famciclovir effectively reduces platelet activation and thrombosis, offering promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for improving CVDs. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39928275/ """,

Hippocampal tissue was used to investigate the relative expression of OS-related genes (nuclear factor [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1)) and histological studies. Seizure behavior was assessed based on Lüttjohann's score. In treated groups, the number of myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) duration decreased significantly, while myoclonic jerks and GTCS latency increased compared with the PTZ group.

""" 30855871: None: Sideroblastic anemia is a rare type that results from abnormal utilization of iron during erythropoiesis. There are different forms of sideroblastic anemia, and all forms are defined by the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Ring sideroblasts are erythroid precursors containing deposits of non-heme iron in mitochondria, forming a ring-like distribution around the nucleus. The iron-formed ring covers at least one-third of the nucleus rim (see Images. Sideroblastic Anemia and Ringed Sideroblasts).  The hemoglobin molecule contains a crucial prosthetic group called heme, integral to its oxygen-carrying function. Structurally, heme consists of a porphyrin ring formed by 4 pyrrole rings connected by methine bridges at the alpha positions, with a central iron atom coordinated within the ring. This iron center enables hemoglobin to bind and transport oxygen efficiently to tissues throughout the body. Other functions of heme apart from the formation of hemoglobin include gas sensing, signal transduction, biological clock, circadian rhythm, and microRNA processing. Sideroblastic anemia results from abnormal erythropoiesis during heme production. Eighty-five percent of heme is produced in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of the erythroblast cells, while the remainder is produced in hepatocytes. In the Shemin pathway, also known as the heme biosynthesis pathway, 8 enzymes catalyze sequential reactions for heme synthesis. These enzymes include aminolevulinic acid synthase, porphobilinogen synthase, porphobilinogen deaminase, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, and ferrochelatase.  There are 2 forms of sideroblastic anemia: hereditary and acquired. Hereditary sideroblastic anemia primarily causes microcytic anemia due to defective heme synthesis, but certain mutations can lead to normocytic or, in rare cases, macrocytic anemia. Unlike iron deficiency anemia, where there is a depletion of iron stores, patients with sideroblastic anemia have normal or high iron levels. Other microcytic anemias include thalassemia and anemia of chronic disease. Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is an acquired form of sideroblastic anemia that is classified as a type of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is characterized by anemia and the presence of 15% or more ring sideroblasts in the marrow. Generally, the patient presents with normochromic, normocytic anemia with overall erythroid hyperplasia as the body attempts to compensate for ineffective erythropoiesis. The hemoglobin level is generally 9 to 12 g/dL, though lower levels may be present. The red blood cells may show dimorphism (with both hypochromic and normochromic populations) and variable degrees of dyserythropoietic and occasional megaloblastic features. Granulopoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis are normal. Platelet and neutrophil counts can vary but are typically normal or mildly increased. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30855871/ """,

Fifty C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into normal control diet(NCD) group, HFD group, and low-and high-dose SPJ groups. At week 12, six mice from the HFD group were further divided into a control group(treated with DMSO) and an exogenous fibroblast growth factor 21(FGF21) group(administered rFGF21). The anxiety-like behavior of the mice was assessed using the open field test and elevated plus maze test. Hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining and oil red O staining were performed to observe pathological changes in the liver and adipose tissue. Glucose metabolism was evaluated through the glucose tolerance test(GTT) and insulin tolerance test(ITT). Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of FGF21 and its downstream-related proteins in the liver and cortex, along with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF), disks large homolog 4(DLG4), and synaptophysin(SYP) in the cortex. Real-time quantitative fluorescent PCR(qPCR) was used to detect the expression of FGF21 and its receptor genes in the liver and cortex. Immunofluorescence staining was employed to examine the expression of neuronal activator c-Fos, FGF21, and the FGF21 co-receptor β-klotho in the cerebral cortex. The results showed that SPJ significantly improved the frequency of activity in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and the central area of the open field in HFD mice, up-regulated the expression of BDNF, DLG4, and SYP, and effectively alleviated anxiety-like behaviors in HFD mice. Compared with the NCD group, HFD mice exhibited up-regulated expression of FGF21 in the liver and cerebral cortex, while the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1(FGFR1) and β-klotho was significantly down-regulated, suggesting that HFD mice exhibited FGF21 resistance. SPJ markedly up-regulated the β-klotho levels in HFD mice, reversing FGF21 resistance. Further comparison with exogenously administered FGF21 revealed that SPJ activates brain cortical regions in a consistent manner, and additionally, SPJ promotes the number and colocalization of c-Fos and β-klotho positive cells in the brain cortex. In summary, SPJ effectively alleviates anxiety-like behaviors in HFD mice. Its mechanism is associated with up-regulation of β-klotho expression in the brain, reversal of FGF21 resistance, and subsequent activation of neurons in the cerebral cortex and amygdala. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39929644/ """,

""" 39922722: Major depressive disorder is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder and one of the leading causes of disability in developed countries. Treatment-resistant depression is defined as the failure of at least two adequate treatment trials. The Muenke Syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family has often been implicated in mood disorders in the literature. We present here the case of a patient with a treatment-resistant depression and a concomitant Muenke Syndrome. We propose a relationship between the two pathologies as the expression of the FGF family has been shown to be dysregulated in depressed humans, post-mortem depressed human's brains and rodent's models of depression and anxiety. In particular, FGFR3 and its major ligand, FGF9, had been shown to be down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively, in cortical areas implicated in mood disorders. Since the FGF family plays a key role in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, among others things, a genetic mutation in a member of the family, such as FGFR3, could lead to depressive symptoms, as in our reported case. The implication is that the FGF family may be an important target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We also conclude that depressive symptoms should be investigated in cases of Muenke Syndrome, as FGF dysregulation in depressed patients. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39922722/ """,
""" 39923962: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic that greatly increases mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important mechanism of cardiac injury in CKD. High serum levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 in patients with CKD may contribute mechanistically to the pathogenesis of LVH by activating FGF receptor (FGFR) 4 signaling in cardiac myocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac metabolic remodeling are early features of cardiac injury that predate development of hypertrophy, but these mechanisms have been insufficiently studied in models of CKD. We found in wild-type mice with CKD induced by adenine diet, that morphological changes occurred in mitochondrial structure and cardiac mitochondrial and that metabolic dysfunction preceded the development of LVH. In bioengineered cardio-bundles and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes grown in vitro, FGF23-mediated activation of FGFR4 caused mitochondrial pathology, characterized by increased bioenergetic stress and increased glycolysis that preceded the development of cellular hypertrophy. The cardiac metabolic changes and associated mitochondrial alterations in mice with CKD were prevented by global and cardiac-specific deletion of FGFR4. Our findings indicate that metabolic remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction are early cardiac complications of CKD that precede structural remodeling of the heart. Mechanistically, FGF23-mediated activation of FGFR4 causes mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that early pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR4 might serve as novel therapeutic intervention to prevent development of LVH and heart failure in patients with CKD. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39923962/ """,

Single brief exposures (10 min) to low energy (1.5 mT) pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) were previously shown to enhance myogenesis by stimulating transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1)-mediated Ca2+ entry, whereby downwardly directed fields produced greater myogenic enhancement than upwardly directed fields. Here, we show that growth in the dark results in myoblasts losing their sensitivity to both magnetic field exposure and directionality. By contrast, overexpressing or silencing cryptochrome circadian regulator 2 (CRY2) in myoblasts enhances or reduces PEMF responses, respectively, under conditions of ambient light. Reducing cellular flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) content by silencing riboflavin kinase (RFK) attenuated responsiveness to PEMFs and inhibited selectivity for magnetic field direction. The upregulation of TRPC1 and cell cycle regulatory proteins typically observed in response to PEMF exposure was instead attenuated by upwardly directed magnetic fields, growth in the darkness, magnetic shielding, or the silencing of CRY2 or RFK. A physical interaction between CRY2 and TRPC1 was detected using coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, revealing their co-translocation into the nucleus after PEMF exposure.

The synergistic administration of Fludarabine, a potent STAT1 inhibitor, with conventional chemotherapy regimens, augments the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs against AML cells and the sensitivity of LSCs to chemotherapy. In a word, STAT1, as a switch, enables leukemia cells convertible in ROS high and low states. Inhibition of STAT1 enables leukemia cells more sensitive to chemotherapy, STAT1 as a new target offers a promising strategy in AML treatment. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954714/ """,
""" 38784340: The current pharmaceutical management of myasthenia gravis (MG) is widely accepted to be pyridostigmine and prednisone, both known to cause adverse effects and incur significant costs. This treatment may be particularly burdensome for patients primarily complaining of localized ocular MG, and little is known about the management of MG ptosis with topical medications. Oxymetazoline hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ptosis, but there have been limited studies in MG ptosis and no report to date of symptomatic improvement with the intranasal formulation. This case report discusses a 71-year-old female whose newly diagnosed MG ptosis resolved after three days of intranasal oxymetazoline hydrochloride 0.05%, followed by three days of intranasal flunisolide. Our patient's rapid resolution of symptoms, along with the favorable side effect profile and over-the-counter availability, highlights the promising indication for the use of intranasal oxymetazoline and flunisolide as potential alternatives or adjuncts in MG management. Further research in larger cohorts is necessary to confirm the efficacy of these nasal sprays in treating MG ptosis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38784340/ """,

""" 39927566: RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of radiation retinopathy is influenced by radiation dose, fractionation schedule, and patient-specific factors such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Advances in imaging techniques, including optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA), have enhanced early detection by identifying subclinical retinal changes. Novel insights into pathophysiology suggest a role for endothelial damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress in disease progression. Prophylactic approaches, such as intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, have shown promise in reducing the onset of retinopathy in high-risk patients. Therapeutic options, including intravitreal anti-VEGF and corticosteroids, have demonstrated efficacy in managing macular edema and preserving vision. However, the outcomes remain variable, necessitating personalized treatment strategies. To address some of these unanswered questions, the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR) Protocol AL is currently enrolling patients and preparing to analyze the long-term effects of treating patients prophylactically with intravitreal faricimab or the 0.19 mg fluocinolone acetonide implant compared to observation, to identify which patients will benefit from which specific regimen, therefore moving towards a personalized approach for this condition as well. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39927566/ """,

""" 39449424: Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a prevalent condition in adults, significantly affecting the global elderly population, with a higher incidence in women than in men. The modulation of gene expression through microRNA (miRNA) partly regulated the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous research identified a functional analysis of seven genes (CDS2, HDAC5, PPP6R2, PRRC2B, TBC1D22A, WNK1, and PABPC3) as targets of miRNAs related to CVD. In this context, miRNAs emerge as essential candidates for CVD diagnosis, representing novel molecular and biological knowledge. This work aims to identify, by network analysis, the miRNAs involved in CVD as potential biomarkers, either by interacting with small molecules such as toxins and pollutants or by searching for new drugs. Our study shows an updated landscape of the signaling pathways involving miRNAs in CVD pathology. This latest research includes data found through experimental tests and uses predictions to propose both miRNAs and genes as potential biomarkers to develop diagnostic and therapeutic methods for the early detection of CVD in the clinical setting. In addition, our pharmacological network analysis has, for the first time, shown how to use these potential biomarkers to find small molecules that may regulate them. Between the small molecules in this research, toxins, pollutants, and drugs showed outstanding interactions with these miRNAs. One of them, hesperidin, a widely prescribed drug for treating CVD and modulating the gene expression associated with CVD, was used as a reference for searching for new molecules that may interact with miRNAs involved in CVD. Among the drugs that exhibit the same miRNA expression profile as hesperidin, potential candidates include desoximetasone, curcumin, flurandrenolide, trifluridine, fludrocortisone, diflorasone, gemcitabine, floxuridine, and reversine. Further investigation of these drugs is essential to improve the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

""" 39048308: Folate-dependent one-carbon (C1) metabolism encompasses distinct cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways connected by an interchange among serine, glycine, and formate. In both the cytosol and mitochondria, folates exist as polyglutamates, with polyglutamylation catalyzed by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), including cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms. Serine is metabolized by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT)2 in the mitochondria and generates glycine and C1 units for cellular biosynthesis in the cytosol. AGF347 is a novel pyrrolo[3,2-day]pyrimidine antifolate that targets SHMT2 in the mitochondria and SHMT1 and de novo purine biosynthesis in the cytosol. FPGS is expressed in primary pancreatic cancer specimens, and FPGS levels correlate with in vitro efficacies of AGF347 toward human pancreatic cancer cells. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells with CRISPR knockout of FPGS were engineered to express doxycycline-inducible FPGS exclusively in the cytosol (cFPGS) or in both the cytosol and mitochondria (mFPGS). Folate and AGF347 accumulations increased in both the cytosol and mitochondria with increased mFPGS but were restricted to the cytosol with cFPGS. AGF347-Glu<sub>5</sub> inhibited SHMT2 ∼19-fold greater than AGF347 By metabolomics analysis, mFPGS stimulated the C1 flux from serine in the mitochondria and de novo purine and dTTP synthesis far greater than cFPGS. mFPGS enhanced in vitro inhibition of MIA PaCa-2 cell proliferation by AGF347 (∼30-fold) more than cFPGS (∼4.9-fold). Similar results were seen with other pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine antifolates (AGF291, AGF320); however, elevated mFPGS adversely impacted inhibition by the nonclassical SHMT2/SHMT1 inhibitor SHIN1. These results suggest a critical role of mFPGS levels in determining antitumor efficacies of mitochondrial-targeted pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine antifolates for pancreatic cancer. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: AGF347 is a novel pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine antifolate that targets serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT)2 in the mitochondria and SHMT1 and de novo purine biosynthesis in the cytosol. AGF347 accumulation increases with folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) levels in both the cytosol and mitochondria. Increased mitochondrial FPGS stimulated one-carbon metabolic fluxes in the cytosol and mitochondria and substantially enhanced in vitro inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells by AGF347.

""" 39922247: Density is an important aquaculture parameter. When the pearl gentian grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀ × E. lanceolatus♂) is farmed intensively, it could lead to a degradation in genetic resources and an increase in disease outbreaks. The composition of the intestinal microbiota plays a key role in creating a specific intestinal microecosystem, which is essential for the survival, growth, and immune response of the host under environmental stress like overcrowding. This study utilized 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics analysis techniques to investigate the differences in intestinal microbial community stability of grouper under different stocking time and density pressure conditions. The research results showed that compared to the low-density group, the high-density group of groupers experienced an increase in mortality rate and feed coefficient in the early stages of culture, while the weight gain rate decreased. Differential analysis of intestinal microbial communities revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota of grouper between different density groups after 10 days of culture, but no significant differences were observed after 20 days of culture. At the same time, intestinal histopathology showed that the high-density group of groupers exhibited a reduction in intestinal villi length and thickness of the intestinal wall after 10 days of culture. However, the intergroup differences had reduced after 20 days of culture. Furthermore, high density cultivation upregulated the expression of inflammatory factors like IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6 in the intestinal tract of groupers after 10 days of culture. However, after 20 days of culture, the expression levels of intestinal inflammatory factors in both the high-density and low-density groups of groupers were significantly reduced, and the differences between the intergroup diminished. Through correlation analysis of differential metabolites and species in the intestine, multiple metabolites significantly upregulated and associated with the upregulation of the Staphylococcus genus were identified in the intestinal tract of groupers after 20 days of high-density cultivation. The selected four associated metabolites (including creatine, fosinopril, 4-aminobutyric acid, and guanidinopropanoic acid) were validated to significantly reduce the expression of cellular inflammatory factors using the self-established grouper head kidney (HK) cell line. In conclusion, density pressure in the early culture period could affect the stability of the intestinal microbial environment of grouper. As aquaculture time increases, the intestinal microbial community of grouper drives the body's anti-inflammatory response and enhanced its adaptation to density pressure by regulating own structure and secretion of metabolites. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39922247/ """,
""" 37954960: The COVID-19 pandemic was declared due to the spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Viral infection is caused by the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2). Previous computational studies have identified repurposed small molecules that target the RBD, but very few have screened drugs in the RBD-hACE2 interface. When studies focus solely on the binding affinity between the drug and the RBD, they ignore the effect of hACE2, resulting in an incomplete analysis. We screened ACE inhibitors and previously identified SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors for binding to the RBD-hACE2 interface, and then conducted 500 ns of unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of fosinopril, fosinoprilat, lisinopril, emodin, diquafosol, and physcion bound to the interface to assess the binding characteristics of these ligands. Based on MM-GBSA analysis, all six ligands bind favorably in the interface and inhibit the RBD-hACE2 interaction. However, when we repeat our simulation by first binding the drug to the RBD before interacting with hACE2, we find that fosinopril, fosinoprilat, and lisinopril result in a strongly interacting trimeric complex (RBD-drug-hACE2). Hydrogen bonding and pairwise decomposition analyses further suggest that fosinopril is the best RBD inhibitor. However, when lisinopril is bound, it stabilizes the trimeric complex and, therefore, is not an ideal potential drug candidate. Overall, these results reveal important atomistic interactions critical to the binding of the RBD to hACE2 and highlight the significance of including all protein partners in the evaluation of a potential drug candidate. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37954960/ """,

Using computational modeling with AlphaFold2, combined with western blotting and in vivo clotting assays, we developed and tested several AAV8-BDDF8 variants in a hemophilia A mouse model. The AAV8-BDDF8-ΔRHQR10 variant, which includes a 10-amino acid deletion at the RHQR site, demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in F8 activity, with sustained expression and no hepatotoxicity. This variant also showed reduced capsid stress and enhanced protein expression. However, the observed decline in long-term efficacy highlights the ongoing challenges in AAV-F8 gene therapy, emphasizing the need for continuous improvements. Our findings offer valuable insights for refining AAV-mediated gene therapy in hemophilia A, showing that targeted molecular modifications can significantly enhance therapeutic performance while ensuring safety. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39949501/ """,
