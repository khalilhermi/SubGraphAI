Here, we describe a 15-year-old male, presented with clinical features of Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) such as dystrophic nails, skin discoloration with additional clinical features of uniform reticulate-brown hued hyperpigmentation, developmental delay, mild intellectual disability, mucositis and anemia. Genomic analysis using high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) identified a novel splice site deletion (c.562+4_562+7del) in the LMBRD1 gene resulting in Cbl deficiency. cDNA sequencing elucidated exon 6 skipping as a consequence of a novel deletion, resulting in significant structural alterations of LMBD1 protein, which was further validated by in-silico computational analysis. Computational modeling and docking studies revealed a reduced interaction affinity between the LMBD1 protein and its partner protein ABCD4. These alterations contribute to a disrupted cascade mechanism in cobalamin (Cbl) metabolism resulting in development of variable clinical phenotypes. In our case, the proband was treated with intravenous hydroxocobalamin therapy and follow up showed a significant improvement in clinical symptoms of skin hyperpigmentation, angular cheilitis and aphthous ulcers.

Methods: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NCRs and FLAI in NPM1+ AML, we retrospectively analyzed 125 patients treated with FLAI (n = 53) or NCRs (n = 72) at seven Italian Centers. Results: The median age was 61 years and 51/125 (41%) were FLT3-ITD+. The complete remission (CR) rate was 77%, slightly better with NCRs (83% vs. 68%; p = 0.054).

""" 39504332: Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has been shown to be a viable therapeutic approach to treating sickle cell disease and potentially other β-hemoglobinopathies. To identify targets and target-modulating small molecules that enhance HbF expression, we engineered a human umbilical-derived erythroid progenitor reporter cell line (HUDEP2_HBG1_HiBiT) by genetically tagging a HiBiT peptide to the carboxyl (C)-terminus of the endogenous HBG1 gene locus, which codes for γ-globin protein, a component of HbF. Employing this reporter cell line, we performed a chemogenomic screen of approximately 5000 compounds annotated with known targets or mechanisms that have achieved clinical stage or approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Among them, 10 compounds were confirmed for their ability to induce HbF in the HUDEP2 cell line. These include several known HbF inducers, such as pomalidomide, lenalidomide, decitabine, idoxuridine, and azacytidine, which validate the translational nature of this screening platform. We identified avadomide, autophinib, triciribine, and R574 as novel HbF inducers from these screens. We orthogonally confirmed HbF induction activities of the top hits in both parental HUDEP2 cells as well as in human primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Further, we demonstrated that pomalidomide and avadomide, but not idoxuridine, induced HbF expression through downregulation of several transcriptional repressors such as BCL11A, ZBTB7A, and IKZF1. These studies demonstrate a robust phenotypic screening workflow that can be applied to large-scale small molecule profiling campaigns for the discovery of targets and pathways, as well as novel therapeutics for sickle cell disease and other β-hemoglobinopathies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39504332/ """,
""" 12573254: In human adults, the enzymatic hydrolysis of dietary fat along the digestive tract is sequentially catalyzed by two main enzymes, human gastric lipase (HGL) and human pancreatic lipase (HPL). Both a chemically inhibited form of HPL as well as an inactive HPL mutant with a glycine residue substituted for its catalytic serine were found to be strong inactivators of HPL activity. In the presence of bile salts, this inhibition was clearly due to competition for colipase. We established that the chemically inhibited HPL, probably in its open conformation, had a much greater affinity for colipase than the closed native form of HPL. These inhibitory effects are quite substantial, because a 0.2-M excess of the chemically inhibited HPL form relative to HPL reduced the catalytic lipolytic activity by 50% in the presence of an equimolar amount of colipase. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12573254/ """,
""" 39531924: Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) are primarily engaged in the regulation of fundamental cellular processes. Overexpression and mutations in these tyrosine kinases cause a variety of malignancies, including lung cancer. The current study addresses the suppression of inactive and mutant variants of the EGFR target site via two primary proposals: (1) To prevent the formation of its mutant form by inhibiting inactive EGFR. (2) To suppress the mutant EGFR directly. After the virtual screening of a newly designed series of hybrid models, selected molecules were synthesized and well-characterized from various spectroscopic and spectrometric methods. The critical analysis and chemistry behind the structural interactions of the selected compounds with three target sites were discussed i.e., inactive EGFR (PDB code: 1XKK), mutant EGFR (PDB code: 3W2O), and allosteric site of mutant EGFR (PDB code: 6P1L). It was observed that compound 7 showed effective results in terms of docking score, structural interactions as well as orientation in the binding pocket towards the inactive target site. Whereas, compound 8 exhibited all the above-mentioned features excellently against mutant EGFR. Apart from that, the investigations were expanded to study the structural behaviour in the allosteric site, where compound 8 once again performed effectively. Such proposals were further clarified by running molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 ns towards inactive, mutant, and allosteric sites of mutant EGFR. Where compounds 7, and 8 demonstrated highly consistence behaviour during the whole simulation trajectory. Further, in vitro results of EGFR inhibition assay and anti-proliferative activity were found in accordance with the computational findings. For the EGFR inhibition assay, compounds 7, and 8 showed excellent IC<sub>50</sub> values of 20.7, and 22.5 μM respectively. Moreover, IC<sub>50</sub> values exhibited by both the compounds in anti-proliferative activity were observed to be 27.5, and 11.7 μM respectively. Thus, compounds 7 and 8 may have potential to become good anticancer agents. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39531924/ """,

""" 39664571: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as sunitinib, have emerged as promising agents in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treatment, particularly in patients at advanced/metastatic clinical stages. However, acquired resistance to sunitinib is common following prolonged clinical treatment in RCC. Increasing evidence has demonstrated a strong correlation between inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKBKE) and cancer progression as well as drug resistance. Here, we found that IKBKE is upregulated in RCC tissues and sunitinib-resistant RCC cells. High IKBKE expression is positively correlated with advanced clinical staging and a poor prognosis in RCC. Silencing IKBKE downregulates ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) and induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, suppressing RCC progression and enhancing sunitinib sensitivity to RCC cells. Mechanistically, IKBKE interacts with and phosphorylates RRM2 to activate the AKT signaling pathway to promotes RCC progression and sunitinib resistance. Notably, the IKBKE inhibitor CYT387 restores sunitinib sensitivity in RCC cells by downregulating RRM2 expression. Collectively, these results indicate that inhibition of IKBKE restrains RCC progression and enhances sunitinib sensitivity by downregulating RRM2 through the RRM2-AKT pathway, suggesting that IKBKE may be a potential therapeutic target for RCC. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39664571/ """,
""" 39955468: Despite the widespread use of metabolomics and proteomics to explore the molecular landscape of depression, there is a lack of consensus regarding dysregulated molecules with replicable evidence. Thus, this study aimed to identify robust metabolomic and proteomic features in depression by integrating evidence from large-scale studies. In this study, a knowledge base-mining approach was adopted to compile a list of dysregulated molecules derived from metabolomic and proteomic studies. A vote-counting approach was performed to identify consistently altered molecules in the blood and urine samples of patients with depression. A total of 2398 molecular entries were selected, comprising 857 unique metabolites and 468 unique proteins from 143 metabolomic and 23 proteomic studies in depression. The results of vote-counting analyses revealed that 11 metabolites in blood and 5 metabolites in urine exhibited consistent disturbances across studies. Circulating levels of glutamic acid and phosphatidylcholine (32:0) were elevated in depressive patients, whereas the levels of tryptophan, kynurenic acid, kynurenine, acetylcarnitine, serotonin, creatinine, inosine, phenylalanine, and valine were lower. Urinary levels of isobutyric acid, alanine, and nicotinic acid were higher, whereas the levels of N-methylnicotinamide and tyrosine were lower. Moreover, analysis of the proteomic dataset identified only one circulating protein, ceruloplasmin, that was consistently dysregulated. Convergence comparison prioritized tryptophan as the top-ranked circulating metabolite, followed by kynurenic acid, acetylcarnitine, creatinine, serotonin, and valine. Collectively, robust evidence of metabolomic changes was observed in patients with depression, pointing to a role as potential biomarkers.

""" 39550394: The remobilization of stored assimilates from stems to seeds plays a pivotal role in augmenting barley yield, particularly under water stress conditions. This study examines the molecular mechanisms underlying stem reserve utilization by conducting a comparative analysis of the proteome and metabolome across three barley contrasting genotypes: Yousef, Morocco, and PBYT17. Evaluations were performed at 21 and 28 days after anthesis (DAA) under both water stress and control conditions. The results indicate that the Yousef genotype exhibits superior remobilization of stem reserves, thereby demonstrating its potential to thrive even in adverse environmental conditions. Utilizing advanced quantitative proteomics and targeted metabolomics, this investigation identified a significant number of metabolites and proteins exhibiting differential accumulation across the genotypes. Specifically, 17 metabolites and 1580 proteins were catalogued, highlighting the intricate biochemical responses to water stress. Noteworthy enzymes such as sucrose synthase, inositol monophosphatase 3, and galactokinase were found to be closely associated with remobilization efficiency. In the drought-tolerant genotype, these enzymes maintained stable levels, in stark contrast to the decline observed in the susceptible genotype. This stability is crucial for promoting seed development through ascorbic acid synthesis and for mitigating oxidative stress, which is exacerbated by drought conditions. The elevated levels of certain metabolites, including glucose 6-phosphate, and UDP-glucose, in the drought-tolerant genotype suggest a robust mechanism for maintaining signalling molecules for carbon availability, which is then instrumental in regulating plant growth and seed size development. The findings from this study strongly imply that the drought-tolerant genotype, through enhanced antioxidant capacity, can effectively produce energy-rich storage compounds, thereby optimizing carbon allocation under water stress. Such insights are invaluable for future breeding strategies aimed at improving barley resilience in the face of climate variability. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39550394/ """,

""" 39908369: Metamorphosis is an important way for insects to adapt to the environment. In this process, larval tissue destruction regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and adult tissue reconstruction regulated by insulin-like peptides (ILPs) occur simultaneously, but the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Here, the results of succinylome, subcellular localization, and protein interaction analysis show that non-succinylated insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) localizes in the cytoplasm, binds to insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2-like), and degrades it. When the metamorphosis is initiated, 20E up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a) through transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), thus increasing the level of IDE succinylation on K179. Succinylated IDE translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with ecdysone receptor to promote 20E signaling pathway, causing larval tissue destruction, while IGF-2-like was released to promote adult tissue proliferation. That is, succinylation alters subcellular localization of IDE so that it can bind to different target proteins and act as a hub of metamorphosis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39908369/ """,

The prevalence of depression is high in adolescents, who are hypersensitive to chronic stress. Traditional pediatric massage (TPM) can effectively relieve depression.

Unfortunately, acquired FOLFIRI resistance represents a common obstacle in the treatment of mCRC patients. Thus, we aimed to identify mechanisms, gene alterations and gene expression signatures contributing to acquired FOLFIRI resistance by mimicking this problem in a cell culture model and subsequent translation in clinical datasets. Three FOLFIRI resistant CRC cell lines were established by continuous FOLFIRI treatment. Comparative mutation screening (161 genes) and transcriptomics (pathway and differential expression analyses) were performed in parental and resistant cells. Data reconciliation was performed in GSE62322, a clinical FOLFIRI responder dataset (intrinsic resistance). Relapse-free survival (RFS) associations of identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and potential gene signatures were investigated in eight clinical CRC datasets. No mutual genetic alterations were found in FOLFIRI resistant derivatives. Resistant cell lines displayed activation of MAPK, immune response and EMT pathways. 12 DEGs, significantly differentially expressed in at least two of the three resistant cell lines, were identified. Comparison with GSE62322 and subsequent survival analyses revealed a five-gene FOLFIRI signature comprised of CAV2, TNC, TACSTD2, SERPINE2, and PERP that was associated with RFS in multiple datasets including TCGA CRC (Hazard ratio (HR)=2.634, p=4.53x10-6), in pooled samples of all datasets (all stages (N=1981): HR=1.852, p=6.44x10-13; stage IV (N=260): HR=2.462, p=5.22x10-9).

""" 39263345: Depression, a global cause of disability and premature death, is often treated by traditional healers in Africa using medicinal herbs such as Ximenia americana (L.). With recent pharmacological studies showing the potential antidepressant properties of X. americana extract, this study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of the compound(s) isolated from X. americana extract using the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) models predictive of depression. The extracts, administered orally within a dose range of 100-400 mg/kg, notably decreased the immobility time in both the FST and the TST. The most significant reduction occurred at the highest dose of 400 mg/kg, with a decrease of 117.66 s in FST and 53.5 s in TST. However, this reduction in immobility was not linked to changes in movements, as observed in an open-field test (OFT), suggesting that the effect of the extracts was not due to activation of locomotion. Subsequently, a sesquiterpene lactone, dehydrocostus lactone (1) was isolated through solubility-based fractionation and column chromatography of the active root bark extract of X. americana. Dehydrocostus lactone (400 mg/kg) demonstrated a 46.50 s reduction in immobility time in the FST, which was comparable to the positive control, imipramine (30 mg/kg). With a highly favorable docking score of -8.365 kcal/mol on an antidepressant target, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A; pdb ID: 2BXS), dehydrocostus lactone (1) potentially outperforms the standard MAO-A inhibitor drug, isocarboxazid (-5.847 kcal/mol). Dehydrocostus lactone (1) displayed strong interactions involving hydrogen bond and hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with specific MAO-A binding site residues. These findings highlight that the antidepressant-like activity of X. americana is partly attributed to the presence of dehydrocostus lactone. Additionally, it also supports the traditional medicinal use of the plant for treating depression. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39263345/ """,

""" 39497181: Acute intoxication with cholinesterase inhibiting organophosphates (OP) can produce life-threatening cholinergic crisis and status epilepticus (SE). Survivors often develop long-term neurological consequences, including spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and impaired cognition. Numerous studies implicate OP-induced neuroinflammation as a pathogenic mechanism contributing to these chronic sequelae; however, little is known about the inflammatory phenotype of innate immune cells in the brain following acute OP intoxication. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the natural history of microglial and astrocytic inflammatory phenotypes following acute intoxication with the OP, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single dose of DFP (4 mg/kg, sc) followed by standard medical countermeasures. Within minutes, animals developed benzodiazepine-resistant SE as determined by monitoring seizures using a modified Racine scale. At 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 d post-exposure (DPE), neuroinflammation was assessed using translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In both sexes, we observed consistently elevated radiotracer uptake across all examined brain regions and time points. A separate group of animals was euthanized at these same time points to collect tissues for immunohistochemical analyses. Colocalization of IBA-1, a marker for microglia, with iNOS or Arg1 was used to identify pro- and anti-inflammatory microglia, respectively; colocalization of GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, with C3 or S100A10, pro- and anti-inflammatory astrocytes, respectively. We observed shifts in the inflammatory profiles of microglia and astrocyte populations during the first month post-intoxication, largely in hyperintense inflammatory lesions in the piriform cortex and amygdala regions. In these areas, iNOS+ proinflammatory microglial cell density peaked at 3 and 7 DPE, while anti-inflammatory Arg1+ microglia cell density peaked at 14 DPE. Pro- and anti-inflammatory astrocytes emerged within 7 DPE, and roughly equal ratios of C3+ pro-inflammatory and S100A10+ anti-inflammatory astrocytes persisted at 28 DPE. In summary, microglia and astrocytes adopted mixed inflammatory phenotypes post-OP intoxication, which evolved over one month post exposure. These activated cell populations were most prominent in the piriform and amygdala areas and were more abundant in males compared to females. The temporal relationship between microglial and astrocytic responses suggests that initial microglial activity may influence delayed, persistent astrocytic responses. Further, our findings identify putative windows for inhibition of OP-induced neuroinflammatory responses in both sexes to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of anti-inflammation in this context. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39497181/ """,

""" 39812851: CONCLUSION: The role of endothelial dysfunction in acute ischemic stroke has been studied increasingly in recent years. It has been shown that there is a correlation between endothelial dysfunction and parenchymal hematoma after endovascular thrombectomy. Also, early clinical trials are conducted investigating, e.g., endothelial progenitor cells in the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in ischemic stroke. Current research focuses on the integration of novel markers of endothelial dysfunction into routine clinical practice to support decision making in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39812851/ """,
""" 38484105: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Individuals with clinical manifestations of isovaleric acidemia (IVA) have either classic IVA identified on newborn screening or classic IVA with a later diagnosis due to a missed diagnosis or later onset of clinical manifestations. Classic IVA is characterized by acute metabolic decompensations (vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, hypotonia, seizures, and a distinct odor of sweaty feet). Acute metabolic decompensations are typically triggered by fasting, (febrile) illness (especially gastroenteritis), or increased protein intake. Clinical deterioration often occurs within hours to days after birth. Additional manifestations of classic IVA include developmental delay, intellectual disability and/or impaired cognition, epilepsy, and movement disorder (tremor, dysmetria, extrapyramidal movements). Early treatment in those identified by newborn screening can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in individuals with classic IVA. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38484105/ """,
""" 38484105: DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of classic IVA is established in a proband by identification of C5-carnitine metabolites by tandem mass spectrometry and isovalerylglycine (IVG) and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIVA) on analysis of urinary organic acids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, or identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in IVD by molecular genetic testing. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38484105/ """,
""" 38484105: MANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Low-leucine/protein-reduced diet and the supplementation of a leucine-free formula in infants or leucine-free amino acid mixture in older children; carnitine and/or glycine supplementation. Supportive care: Routine daily treatment includes education of affected individuals and caregivers about the natural history, maintenance and emergency treatment, prognosis, and risks of acute encephalopathic crises; emergency treatment letter and MedicAlert®; management of movement disorder per neurologist; physical therapy and aggressive rehabilitation therapy for gross motor delay; notify metabolic center prior to planned surgeries; consult metabolic disease specialist with any emergency surgery/procedure. Emergency outpatient treatment includes carbohydrate supplementation orally or via tube feeding, transient reduction of natural protein intake, elevation of carnitine supplementation, and glycine; antipyretics for fever; antiemetics for vomiting. Acute inpatient treatment includes stopping protein intake, intravenous glucose, and hydration with normal saline; adjusting treatments for new or evolving neurologic manifestations; consider buffers as needed for life-threatening metabolic acidosis; nitrogen scavengers for hyperammonemia. Surveillance: Quantitative analysis of plasma amino acids at least every three months until age one year, every six months from age one to six years, and annually in those age six years and older; blood gases, albumin, calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, complete blood count, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> at least annually in those on a protein-restricted diet; measurement of growth and head circumference at each visit throughout childhood; monitor weight throughout adulthood; monitor developmental milestones at each visit; neuropsychological testing and standardized quality-of-life assessments as needed; assessment of movement disorder at each visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excess of dietary protein or protein malnutrition inducing catabolic state; prolonged fasting; catabolism during illness. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Biochemical or molecular genetic testing of all at-risk sibs of any age is warranted to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of classic IVA. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38484105/ """,
""" 38484105: GENETIC COUNSELING: Classic IVA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an IVD pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the IVD pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38484105/ """,

""" 39947595: Hoof horn lesions are recurrent in nature and cause long-term pathological challenges to the functional anatomy of the hoof in dairy cattle. It is hypothesized that inflammation is a driver of these pathological changes. It has previously been identified that routine treatment at first and subsequent calving and lameness events with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was important in reducing the future risk of lameness in dairy heifers. The impact NSAID administration has on lameness outcomes for multiparous dairy cattle is unknown. We conducted a 34mo randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of routine administration of the NSAID ketoprofen during treatment for lameness and at calving, on the future probability of lameness and culling, caused by exposure to normal farm conditions. Dairy cattle that had calved at least once were recruited from a single herd, and randomly allocated to one of 4 treatments while controlling for parity, proportion of occasions scored as lame 8wks before study onset, and days in milk. All lactating animals were lameness scored every 2wk, to identify lame animals requiring treatment. Animals in Group 1 received a therapeutic trim and an orthopedic hoof block (if deemed necessary) every time they were treated for lameness. Animals in Group 2 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily), alongside the same treatment as Group 1 every time they were treated for lameness. Animals in Group 3 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily) starting 24 to 36 h after each calving, alongside the same treatment as Group 2 for lameness. Animals in Group 4 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily) every time they were identified with lameness, with no therapeutic trim, unless they were identified as severely lame (a single score ≥ 3a). Animals were followed for the 34mo duration of the study. Independent lameness outcome scores were collected every 2wks by technicians who were blinded to Treatment Group to assess the probability of lameness. Culling data were extracted from farm records. A total of 425 animals were recruited to the study (105 in Group 1, 107 in Group 2, 107 in Group 3 and 106 in Group 4), with data from 412 animals included in the final analysis (n = 102 Group 1, 102 Group 2, 106 Group 3, and 102 Group 4). The effect of Treatment Group on the ongoing probability of lameness was evaluated through the use of mixed effect, logistic regression models. Compared with animals in Group 1, animals in Group 4 were significantly more likely to be identified as lame throughout the study period. No effect on the risk of severe lameness was identified. The effect of Group on time to culling was investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model. No benefit of NSAID or hoof trimming intervention on culling risk was identified. Our results highlight the importance of frequent therapeutic trimming and the application of orthopedic blocks in the treatment of lameness in multiparous animals that may have a history of calving and lameness without NSAID administration. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39947595/ """,
""" 39950695: This trial aimed to compare the success of mental-incisive nerve blocks (MINB) on mandibular premolars with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP) after oral premedication using 10 mg ketorolac or a placebo. One hundred and two patients were randomly divided into two groups. One hour prior to the administration of a MINB the patients were administered oral premedication's of either ketorolac or dextrose (placebo). The success of anaesthesia was verified by the absence of pain during the access cavity preparation or root canal instrumentation. Descriptive analysis was performed and one-way ANOVA was utilised for quantitative variables. Categorical data were analysed using chi-squared tests. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship among age, sex, type of premedication taken, preoperative pain score and tooth length to the pain outcome. The efficacy of MINB on mandibular premolars with SIP was not influenced significantly by the preoperative oral administration of ketorolac.

Ketotifen (KF), a widely used antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer, for treating AC and atopic asthma but belongs to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS II) have poor solubility. This study developed a multiple strategies approach for the first time, utilizing the spanlastics nano-vesicular carriers' system (SP) containing KF using an ethanol injection method. The optimized KF-SP exhibited the smallest particle size, largest zeta-potential and entrapment efficiency ∼232.5 ± 1.9 nm, -28 ± 0.51 and 73 ± 0.02%, respectively were further incorporated into PVA/PVP polymeric dissolving microneedles (MNs) by using a micromolding technique. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed well-defined tips and morphology, and in vitro studies showed a controlled 93% cumulative release over 72 h, with a zero-order kinetic release profile, providing stable therapeutic levels. Pharmacodynamic evaluation using the Ovalbumin/Aluminium hydroxide-induced AC model demonstrated significant reductions in IgE, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels by 68.7%, 71.3%, and 67.6%, respectively, while TGF-β and IL-10 levels increased by 70.1% and 62.7% using ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). Gene expression analysis (IGF-1, Annexin A1, and Bcl2) further supported the therapeutic potential of this system.

""" 39903889: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by elevated hepatic lipids caused by nonalcoholic factors, where histone lactylation is lately discovered as a modification driving disease progression. This research aimed to explore the role of histone 3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18lac) in NAFLD progression using a high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mouse model and free fatty acids (FFA)-treated L-02 cell lines. Lipids accumulation was screened via Oil Red O staining, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting, and commercially available kits. Similarly, molecular mechanism was analyzed using immunoprecipitation (IP), dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA decay assay. Results indicated that FFA upregulated lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and H3K18lac levels in L-02 cells. Besides, LDHA-mediated H3K18lac was enriched on the proximal promoter of methyltransferase 3 (METTL3), translating into an increased expression. Moreover, METTL3 or LDHA knockdown relieved lipid accumulation, decreased total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels, and downregulated lipogenesis-related proteins in FFA-treated L-02 cell lines, in addition to enhancing the m6A and mRNA levels of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1). The m6A modification of SCD1 was recognized by YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F1 (YTHDF1), resulting in enhanced mRNA stability. LDHA was found to be highly expressed in HFD-treated mice, where knocking down LDHA attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. These findings demonstrated that LDHA-induced H3K18lac promoted NAFLD progression, where LDHA-induced H3K18lac in METTL3 promoter elevated METTL3 expression, thereby promoting m6A methylation and stabilizing SCD1 via a YTHDF1-dependent manner.
