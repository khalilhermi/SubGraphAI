""" 16279779: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) exhibits tautomerase activity on phenylpyruvate and has E-stereochemistry preference. To investigate the binding modes of its competitive inhibitors and evaluate their binding affinities, molecular dynamics simulations together with MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) analysis were performed on MIF complexed with (E)-2-fluoro-p-hydroxycinnamate and five analogues. Pro-1 was discovered to form a bifurcated hydrogen bond between its protonated nitrogen and carboxylate oxygens of E-ligands and Tyr-36. No hydrogen bonds were found between Pro-1 and Z-ligands. This distinct binding characteristic of E- and Z-ligands with Pro-1 may be the main factor for the large difference in their binding affinities, which is consistent with the previous report that Pro-1 is essential for the catalytic activity of MIF. MM-PBSA analysis revealed that energy components including van der Waals, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions are in favor of binding, among which electrostatic interactions are predominant to the binding affinity difference. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16279779/ """,
""" 33839361: With the growing challenges of bacteria becoming resistant to conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may offer a potential alternative. One of the most studied AMPs, the human cathelicidin derived AMP LL-37 is notable for its antimicrobial activity even though its mechanism of action is not fully understood yet. This work investigates the interaction of LL-37 with 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (POPG) vesicles, which were employed as a bacterial membrane model given the common presence of this phospholipid in the bacterial membrane. Experimental techniques including small angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering were used to characterize the interactions among LL-37 and POPG. Molecular dynamics simulations complement the experimental studies with molecular-level insights into the process. LL-37 was discovered to actively and critically interact with the POPG vesicles, modifying the membrane curvature that eventually leads to structural transformations from vesicles to mixed micelles. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions among LL-37 and bacteria mimetic vesicles and can guide the further development of AMP based antimicrobial materials and therapies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33839361/ """,

""" 39395798: G protein-coupled receptors transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling. Ca2+ is a well-known second messenger that can be induced by G protein-coupled receptor activation through the primary canonical pathways involving Gα<sub>q</sub>- and Gβγ-mediated activation of phospholipase C-β (PLCβ). While some G<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors are shown to trigger Ca2+ mobilization, underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we evaluated whether G<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors including the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) and the prostaglandin EP<sub>2</sub> and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors (EP<sub>2</sub>R and EP<sub>4</sub>R) that are endogenously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells utilize common pathways for mediating Ca2+ mobilization. For the β<sub>2</sub>AR, we found an essential role for G<sub>q</sub> in agonist-promoted Ca2+ mobilization while genetic or pharmacological inhibition of G<sub>s</sub> or G<sub>i</sub> had minimal effect. β-agonist-promoted Ca2+ mobilization was effectively blocked by the G<sub>q</sub>-selective inhibitor YM-254890 and was not observed in ΔGα<sub>q/11</sub> or ΔPLCβ cells. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analysis also suggests agonist-dependent association of the β<sub>2</sub>AR with G<sub>q</sub>. For the EP<sub>2</sub>R, which couples to G<sub>s</sub>, agonist treatment induced Ca2+ mobilization in a pertussis toxin-sensitive but YM-254890-insensitive manner. In contrast, EP<sub>4</sub>R, which couples to G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i</sub>, exhibited Ca2+ mobilization that was sensitive to both pertussis toxin and YM-254890. Interestingly, both EP<sub>2</sub>R and EP<sub>4</sub>R were largely unable to induce Ca2+ mobilization in ΔGα<sub>s</sub> or ΔPLCβ cells, supporting a strong dependency on G<sub>s</sub> signaling in HEK293 cells. Taken together, we identify differences in the signaling pathways that are used to mediate Ca2+ mobilization in HEK293 cells where the β<sub>2</sub>AR primarily uses G<sub>q</sub>, EP<sub>2</sub>R uses G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub>R uses G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>i</sub>, and G<sub>q</sub>. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39395798/ """,
""" 39870013: The immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor FcεRI (Fc epsilon RI) plays a crucial role in allergic reactions. Recent studies have indicated that the interaction between FcεRIβ and the downstream protein phospholipase C beta 3 (PLCβ3) leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines. The aim of this study was to develop small molecules that inhibit the protein-protein interactions between FcεRIβ and PLCβ3 to treat allergic inflammation. Additionally, PLCβ3 has emerged as a potential target protein for treating allergic inflammation. In this study, we employed a virtual screening technique to search the Taiwan Traditional Chinese Medicine Database, followed by a second screening using absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET). Among the compounds screened, silibinin exhibited the best performance, forming strong hydrogen bond interactions with residues of PLCβ3, with a binding free energy of -119.277 kcal/mol. Therefore, silibinin effectively blocked the interaction between FcεRIβ and PLCβ3. Silibinin reduced the production of allergic inflammatory cytokines, including cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 2a (CINC-2a), interleukin-2 (IL-2), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1), interleukin 1α (IL-1α), macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (MIP3α), interferon γ (IFN-γ), activin A, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 13 (IL-13), Fas ligand (FasL) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), without inducing cytotoxicity. Furthermore, in studies of IgE-mediated allergic responses, silibinin also decreased the expression of surface IgE receptors (FcεRIs). Moreover, silibinin effectively alleviated allergen-induced asthma responses and reduced the infiltration of inflammatory immune cells into the lungs of an OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation mouse model.

Our main findings are as follows: First, the cerebellar vermis in macaques exhibited striped compartmentalization for all markers, with the striped expression boundary of PLCB3 being less distinct than those of Aldoc and PLCB4. Second, the striped pattern was less pronounced in the cerebellar hemisphere compared to the vermis, with signals in the hemisphere being predominantly intense throughout. Third, distinct zonal patterns and elevated signals for Aldoc and PLCB3 were observed in the cerebellar deep nuclei. Specifically, the fastigial nucleus displayed intense Aldoc signals in both caudal and rostral regions, while the dentate nucleus displayed strong Aldoc signals in both ventral and dorsal regions. Compared to previous rodent studies, the macaque cerebellum demonstrated a higher proportion of intense signal areas and distinct compartmentalization patterns in both cortical and deep nuclei.

Furthermore, the relationship among MIR503HG, miR-191-5p, and phospholipase C delta 1 (PLCD1) in VSMCs was disclosed via mechanism assays. Decreased MIR503HG lacked the inhibition on miR-191-5p targeting PLCD1, resulting in downregulation of PLCD1, which facilitated the progression of AAA.

""" 29859928: Ca2+ is an important second messenger, and it is involved in many cellular processes such as cell death and proliferation. The rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels can be due to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP<sub>3</sub>), which is a product of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) hydrolysis by phospholipases C (PLCs), that leads to Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum by InsP<sub>3</sub> receptors (InsP<sub>3</sub>R). Ca2+ signaling patterns can vary in different regions of the cell and increases in nuclear Ca2+ levels have specific biological effects that differ from those of Ca2+ increase in the cytoplasm. There are PLCs in the cytoplasm and nucleus, but little is known about the functions of nuclear PLCs. This work aimed to characterize phenotypically the human PLCδ4 (hPLCδ4) in mesenchymal stem cells. This nuclear isoform of PLC is present in different cell types and has a possible role in proliferative processes. In this work, hPLCδ4 was found to be mainly nuclear in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASC). PLCδ4 knockdown demonstrated that it is essential for hASC proliferation, without inducing cell death. An increase of cells in G1, and a reduction of cells on interphase and G2/M in knockdown cells were seen. Furthermore, PLCδ4 knockdown increased the percentage of senescent cells, p16INK4A+ and p21Cip1 mRNAs expression, which could explain the impaired cell proliferation.

""" 39820281: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most malignant tumors because of its high metastatic ability. The glutamine (Gln)-deficient microenvironment contributes to PDAC metastasis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that melanophilin (MLPH) promotes PDAC metastasis by inducing the regrowth of primary cilia. Using RNA sequencing, we found that MLPH was upregulated in Gln-deficient conditions. MLPH facilitated PDAC metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, high MLPH expression is positively correlated with metastasis and poor PDAC prognosis. MLPH localized to the centrosome and facilitated the regrowth of primary cilia. The primary ciliogenesis upregulated phospholipase C γ-1 (PLCG1) to promote PDAC metastasis. Interestingly, PLCG1 was localized to the primary cilia, and depletion of PLCG1 alleviated primary ciliogenesis, suggesting a feedforward role for PLCG1 in mediating primary ciliogenesis.

Approved medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) exist, yet their limitations indicate a need for innovative treatments.

This review aims to bridge the gap between preclinical findings and potential clinical applications, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Searches included MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on preclinical in vivo studies involving opioids and psychedelics in animals, excluding pain studies and those lacking control groups. Forty studies met criteria, covering both classic and non-classic psychedelics. Most studies showed that 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), ibogaine, noribogaine, and ketamine could reduce opioid self-administration, alleviate withdrawal symptoms, and change conditioned place preference. However, seven studies (two on 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), three on ibogaine, one on 18-MC, and one on ketamine) showed no improvement over controls.

Vitamin D3 is also present in human serum in the sulfated form as are other metabolites. Our aim was to determine whether sulfated forms of vitamin D3 and vitamin D3 metabolites can be acted on by vitamin D-metabolizing cytochromes P450 (CYPs), one of which (CYP11A1) is known to act on cholesterol sulfate. We used purified, bacterially expressed CYPs to test if they could act on the sulfated forms of their natural substrates. Purified CYP27A1 converted vitamin D3 sulfate to 25(OH)D3 3-sulfate with a catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) approximately half that for the conversion of vitamin D3 to 25(OH)D3. Similarly, the rate of metabolism of vitamin D3 sulfate was half that of vitamin D3 for CYP27A1 in rat liver mitochondria. CYP2R1 which is also a vitamin D 25-hydroxylase did not act on vitamin D3 sulfate. CYP11A1 was able to convert vitamin D3 sulfate to 20(OH)D3 3-sulfate but at a considerably lower rate than for conversion of vitamin D3 to 20(OH)D3. 25(OH)D3 3-sulfate was not metabolized by the activating enzyme, CYP27B1, nor by the inactivating enzyme, CYP24A1. Thus, we conclude that 25(OH)D3 3-sulfate in the circulation may act as a pool of metabolically inactive vitamin D3 to be released by hydrolysis at times of need whereas vitamin D3 sulfate can be metabolized in a similar manner to free vitamin D3 by CYP27A1 and to a lesser degree by CYP11A1. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36455719/ """,
""" 39433193: The kidding traits of goats are an important index of production. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of kidding traits in goats have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the molecular regulatory network of kidding traits in goats. Multi-omics revealed the enrichment of 10 signaling pathways, with fatty acid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways being closely related to reproduction. Interestingly, the key rate-limiting enzymes, fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 5 (SCD5), fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3BHSD), and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) enriched in these pathways regulate changes in reproduction-related metabolites. In interference experiments, it was observed that suppressing these key rate-limiting enzymes inhibited the expression of CYP19A1, ESR2, and FSHR. Furthermore, interference inhibited granulosa cell proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis. Thus, these results suggest that the specific markers of nanny goats with multiple kids are the key rate-limiting enzymes FASN, SCD5, FADS1, 3BHSD, and STAR. These findings may greatly enhance the understanding of regulatory mechanisms that govern goat parturition. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39433193/ """,

""" 39941069: Metastasis is a leading cause of mortality in breast cancer, as metastatic disease is often aggressive and resistant to conventional treatments. Cancer cells that spread to distant organs can enter a dormant phase for extended periods, sometimes years or decades. During this dormant phase, cancer cells avoid immune and pharmacological response. Thus, new approaches are needed to prevent these disseminated cells from becoming lethal cancers. Statins are known inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase that have been extensively used in patients with cardiovascular diseases to lower cholesterol. However, recent research has demonstrated their potential in anticancer therapies. Epidemiological evidence suggests that statins are associated with a reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality, although they do not appear to affect the incidence of primary tumors. In this review, we discuss the role of statins in metastasis and dormancy, their cytocidal and cytostatic effects and their interactions with different cell types in the tumor microenvironment. The exact mechanisms by which statins reduce mortality without influencing primary tumor growth remain unclear, also warranting further investigation into their potential role in metastasis and tumor dormancy, which could ultimately help patients to improve survival and quality of life. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39941069/ """,
""" 39409040: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by a T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) inflammatory response leading to skin damage with erythema and edema. Comparative fecal sample analysis has uncovered a strong correlation between AD and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strain A2-165, specifically associated with butyrate production. Therefore, understanding the functional mechanisms of crucial enzymes in the butyrate pathway, such as 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase of A2-165 (A2HBD), is imperative. Here, we have successfully elucidated the three-dimensional structure of A2HBD in complex with acetoacetyl-CoA and NAD+ at a resolution of 2.2Å using the PAL-11C beamline (third generation). Additionally, X-ray data of A2HBD in complex with acetoacetyl-CoA at a resolution of 1.9 Å were collected at PAL-XFEL (fourth generation) utilizing Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SFX). The monomeric structure of A2HBD consists of two domains, N-terminal and C-terminal, with cofactor binding occurring at the N-terminal domain, while the C-terminal domain facilitates dimerization. Our findings elucidate the binding mode of NAD+ to A2HBD. Upon acetoacetyl-CoA binding, the crystal structure revealed a significant conformational change in the Clamp-roof domain (root-mean-square deviation of 2.202 Å). Notably, residue R143 plays a critical role in capturing the adenine phosphate ring, underlining its significance in substrate recognition and catalytic activity. The binding mode of acetoacetyl-CoA was also clarified, indicating its lower stability compared to NAD+. Furthermore, the conformational change of hydrophobic residues near the catalytic cavity upon substrate binding resulted in cavity shrinkage from an open to closed conformation. This study confirms the conformational changes of catalytic triads involved in the catalytic reaction and presents a proposed mechanism for substrate reduction based on structural observations. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39409040/ """,

Recent research has highlighted the significance of palmitic acid (PA) in triggering pro-inflammatory pathways contributing to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, Genomic-scale metabolic models and control theory have revealed that metabolic switches (MSs) are metabolic pathway regulators by potentially exacerbating neurotoxicity, thereby offering promising therapeutic targets. Herein, we characterized these enzymatic MSs in silico as potential therapeutic targets, employing protein-protein and drug-protein interaction networks alongside structural characterization techniques. Our findings indicate that five MSs (P00558, P04406, Q08426, P09110, and O76062) were functionally linked to nervous system drug targets and may be indirectly regulated by specific neurological drugs, some of which exhibit polypharmacological potential (e.g., Trifluperidol, Trifluoperazine, Disulfiram, and Haloperidol).

Notably, as one of the few DSDs where fertility is possible, the clinical presentation of this disease is diverse, and reported cases of assisted reproduction are scarce. The fertility potential, reproductive counseling and treatment depend on the clinical presentation of this DSD, especially the testicular position and urethral anatomy. The influence of the timing and modality of surgery for hypospadias and cryptorchidism should be considered. We aimed to describe the use of microscopic testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) in this population. We provide a descriptive analysis of how micro-TESE is a possible potential tool for assisted reproduction in 5ARD2-deficient patients. A 33-year-old male who underwent bilateral orchidopexy, phalloplasty, and urethroplasty at the age of 9 years presented successful sperm retrieval but failed embryo development after intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Testicular histology revealed late spermatogenic arrest. A 28-year-old male with bilateral orchidopexy, phalloplasty, and urethroplasty at age 25 with unsuccessful sperm retrieval. Testicular histology revealed a Sertoli cell-only pattern. 5ARD2-deficient patients are singular patients. The potential impact of the time between atypical genitalia procedures and orchidopexy on fertility should be highly considered. Micro-TESE is a technique that may be used to assist azoospermic patients in this population.

""" 38243961: Neurological disorders such as epilepsy, autism, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease alter brain functions like cognition, mood, movements, and language, severely compromising the well-being of persons, suffering from their negative effects. The neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, norepinephrine, dopamine) are found to be involved in neuronal signaling and neurotransmission. GABA, a commanding neurotransmitter is directly or indirectly associated with various neurological disorders. GABA is metabolized to succinic semialdehyde by a mitochondrial gamma-aminobutyric acid-transaminase (GABA-T) enzyme. Therefore, the alterations in the GABA performance in the distinct regions of the brain via GABA-T overstimulation or inhibition would play a vital role in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. This review emphasizes the leading participation of GABA-T in neurological disorders like Huntington's disease, epilepsy, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. In Huntington's disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, the surfeited performance of GABA-T results in diminished levels of GABA, whereas in autism, the subsidence of GABA-T activity causes the elevation in GABA contents, which is responsible for behavioral changes in these disorders. Therefore, GABA-T inhibitors (in Huntington's disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis) or agonists (in autism) can be used therapeutically. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, some researchers favor the stimulation of GABA-T activity whereas some disagree with it. Therefore, the activity of GABA-T concerning Alzheimer's disease is still unclear. In this way, studies of GABA-T enzymatic activity in contrast to neurological disorders could be undertaken to understand and be considered a therapeutic target for several GABA-ergic CNS diseases. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38243961/ """,

Here we show that the broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) reversibly inhibits ALDH9A1 in a time-dependent manner. Possible mechanisms of inhibition include covalent reversible inactivation involving the thiohemiacetal intermediate and slow, tight-binding inhibition. Two crystal structures of ALDH9A1 are reported, including the first of the enzyme complexed with NAD+. One of the structures reveals the active conformation of the enzyme, in which the Rossmann dinucleotide-binding domain is fully ordered and the inter-domain linker adopts the canonical β-hairpin observed in other ALDH structures. The oligomeric structure of ALDH9A1 was investigated using analytical ultracentrifugation, small-angle X-ray scattering, and negative stain electron microscopy. These data show that ALDH9A1 forms the classic ALDH superfamily dimer-of-dimers tetramer in solution. Our results suggest that the presence of an aldehyde substrate and NAD+ promotes isomerization of the enzyme into the active conformation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32717224/ """,

Glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2), a plasma membrane glucose sensor, controls hypothalamic primary astrocyte culture glycogen metabolism in vitro. In vivo gene silencing tools and single-cell laser-catapult-microdissection/multiplex qPCR techniques were used here to examine whether GLUT2 governs dorsomedial (VMNdm) and/or ventrolateral (VMNvl) VMN astrocyte metabolic sensor and glycogen metabolic enzyme gene profiles. GLUT2 gene knockdown diminished astrocyte GLUT2 mRNA in both VMN divisions. Hypoglycemia caused GLUT2 siRNA-reversible up-regulation of this gene profile in the VMNdm, but down-regulated VMNvl astrocyte GLUT2 transcription. GLUT2 augmented baseline VMNdm and VMNvl astrocyte glucokinase (GCK) gene expression, but increased (VMNdm) or reduced (VMNvl) GCK transcription during hypoglycemia. GLUT2 imposed opposite control, namely stimulation versus inhibition of VMNdm or VMNvl astrocyte 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase-alpha 1 and -alpha 2 gene expression, respectively. GLUT2 stimulated astrocyte glycogen synthase (GS) gene expression in each VMN division. GLUT2 inhibited transcription of the AMP-sensitive glycogen phosphorylase (GP) isoform GP-brain type (GPbb) in each site, yet diminished (VMNdm) or augmented (VMNvl) astrocyte GP-muscle type (GPmm) mRNA. GLUT2 enhanced VMNdm and VMNvl glycogen accumulation during euglycemia, and curbed hypoglycemia-associated VMNdm glycogen depletion. Results show that VMN astrocytes exhibit opposite, division-specific GLUT2 transcriptional responsiveness to hypoglycemia. Data document divergent GLUT2 control of GCK, AMPK catalytic subunit, and GPmm gene profiles in VMNdm versus VMNvl astrocytes.

""" 39144559: The deregulation of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) is a main issue of cancer cells for increasing their malignancy. In these terms, the sulfation pattern of HS, created by an orchestrated activity of enzymes balancing a site-specific sulfation, is of key importance. These enzymes are often deregulated by epigenetic processes in cancer, e.g., being silenced by DNA hypermethylation. Here, we address this issue in human breast cancer cell lines aiming to target epigenetic processes to reactivate HS sulfation, shifting HS into an antithrombotic phenotype for which 3-O-sulfation is particularly important. Treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with nontoxic concentrations of 5-azacytidine (azacytidine) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (FdCyd) as DNMT inhibitors or vorinostat for targeting HDAC increased HS3-O-sulfation remarkably, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, by upregulating HS3-O-sulfotransferases, detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Flow cytometry and microscopic approaches confirm that upon inhibitor treatment, increased HS3-O-sulfation improves cell binding to antithrombin, leading to an antithrombotic activity. Nevertheless, only azacytidine- and vorinostat-treated cells display anticoagulative properties, represented by attenuated thrombin formation, a lower activation of human platelet aggregation, or ATP release. In contrast, FdCyd additionally upregulated tissue factor expression in both cell lines, overshadowing the anticoagulant effects of HS, leading to an overall prothrombotic phenotype. Our data provide evidence for the first time that targeting epigenetic processes in HS sulfation is a valuable means to foster anticoagulative cell properties for decreasing malignancy and metastatic potency.

The reasons why neutrophils of newborns are less responsive than those of adults are not clear. Because adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine (ADO) tightly regulate neutrophils, we studied whether the ATP and ADO levels in the blood of newborn mice could impair the function of their neutrophils. We observed significant changes in plasma ATP and ADO levels throughout the lifespan of mice. ADO levels in newborns were significantly higher than in older mice, while ATP levels were significantly lower. These changes were particularly striking in newborn and juvenile mice with ATP and ADO levels of about 80 and 600 nM in newborns versus 130 and 190 nM in juveniles, respectively. The ratios of the ATP versus ADO levels of newborns were (with 0.2) significantly lower than those of juveniles (1.4) and adults (0.5). These low ATP/ADO ratios correlated with significantly weakened neutrophil activation responses following in vitro stimulation with a formyl peptide receptor agonist and a markedly higher morbidity and mortality rate of newborns following bacterial infection. We found that enhanced AMP hydrolysis via CD73, a lack of ADO breakdown by adenosine deaminase, and reduced ADO uptake by nucleoside transporters are responsible for the low ATP/ADO ratios in blood of newborn mice. We conclude that the extracellular ADO accumulation in newborn mice impairs inflammatory responses and reduces the ability of neutrophils to mount effective antimicrobial defenses against bacterial infections. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39824218/ """,
""" 39790127: Unveiling novel pathways for drug discovery forms the foundation of a new era in the combat against tuberculosis. The discovery of a novel drug, bedaquiline, targeting mycobacterial ATP synthase highlighted the targetability of the energy metabolism pathway. The significant potency of bedaquiline against heterogeneous population of Mycobacterium tuberculosis marks ATP synthase as an important complex of the electron transport chain. This review focuses on the importance and unique characteristics of mycobacterial ATP synthase. Understanding these distinctions enables the targeting of ATP synthase subunits for drug discovery, without aiming at the mammalian counterpart. Furthermore, a brief comparison of the structural differences between mycobacterial and mitochondrial ATP synthase is discussed. Being a complex multi-subunit protein, ATP synthase offers multiple sites for potential inhibitors, including the a, c, ε, γ, and δ subunits. Inhibitors targeting these subunits are critically reviewed, providing insight into the design of better and more potent chemical entities with the potential for effective treatment regimens. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39790127/ """,
""" 37463546: INTRODUCTION: Placental inflammation is implicated in the pathophysiology of many pregnancy complications, including fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and choriocarcinoma. Mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the outcomes of placental inflammation, is characterized by loss of membrane potential, accumulation of oxygen radicals, mitochondrial protein folding defects, and disturbances in mitochondrial dynamics. Protein kinase R (PKR) is stimulated by double-stranded RNA and bacterial endotoxins in the presence of pathogens and is a critical immune response enzyme. PKR is also correlated with the cell death response during endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of PKR activity stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and double-stranded RNA analog (Poly I:C) on mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR), mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in placental trophoblasts. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37463546/ """,

Similarly, 5r exhibited exceptional dual activity against both α-amylase and α-glucosidase, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.63 µM and 0.14 µM, respectively, highlighting its dual inhibitory potential. Biological assays demonstrated the compounds' low cytotoxicity on hepatic stellate (LX-2) cells, affirming their safety for therapeutic use. Molecular docking studies provided mechanistic insights into their binding interactions, revealing strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with key active site residues. Density functional theory (DFT) and electrostatic potential (ESP) analyses further elucidated their electronic properties, offering a deeper understanding of their structure-activity relationships.

Previous studies found that protein rootletin (PcRoo) is a target protein of arecoline, when interacted with Pomacea canaliculata. In this study, we modeled the target protein through threading, and the binding energy between arecoline and protein PcRoo was calculated as -5.02 kcal/mol by molecular docking. Furthermore, two target compounds, baclofen and acedoben, with molluscicidal activity in theory were obtained by virtual screening in database DrugBank. The in vivo bioassay showed that baclofen could induce typical poisoning symptoms on P. canaliculata, which were characterized by weakness of foot muscles and loss of gill cilia, and the LC<sub>50</sub> value was 16.2437 mg/L (72 h). Additionally, after 15 mg/L baclofen treatment, the oxygen consumption rate, ammonia excretion rate, and oxygen nitrogen ratio of P. canaliculata declined. Furthermore, the treatment of baclofen also decreased the gene expression level of PcRoo. These trends were the same as the changes after 5 mg/L arecoline treatment. The pharmacophore characteristics were further analyzed, and the results showed that the chemical structures of baclofen and arecoline were correlated in molluscicidal activity.

Current 4D magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) techniques primarily focus on macrovascular structures, yet few have quantified hemodynamic timing. This study introduces a novel model to estimate macrovascular arterial transit time (mATT) derived from arterial spin labeling (ASL)-based 4D-MRA. We provide examples of our method that visualize mATT differences throughout the brain of patients with intracranial steno-occlusive disease (moyamoya), as well as changes in mATT resulting from the cerebrovascular reactivity response to an acetazolamide (ACZ) injection.

""" 38642318: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a serious public health problem both in our country and worldwide, being the most prevalent type of diabetes. The combined use of drugs in the treatment of T2DM leads to serious side effects, including gastrointestinal problems, liver toxicity, hypoglycemia, and treatment costs. Hence, there has been a growing emphasis on drugs that demonstrate dual interactions. Several studies have suggested that dual-target agents for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) and alpha-glucosidase (α-glucosidase) could be a potent approach for treating patients with diabetes. We aim to develop new antidiabetic agents that target PPAR-γ and α-glucosidase enzymes using molecular modeling techniques. These compounds show dual interactions, are more effective, and have fewer side effects. The molecular docking method was employed to investigate the enzyme-ligand interaction mechanisms of 159 newly designed compounds with target enzymes. Additionally, we evaluated the ADME properties and pharmacokinetic suitability of these compounds based on Lipinski and Veber's rules. Compound 70, which exhibited favorable ADME properties, demonstrated more effective binding energy with both PPAR-γ and α-glucosidase enzymes (-12,16 kcal/mol, -10.07 kcal/mol) compared to the reference compounds of Acetohexamide (-9.31 kcal/mol, -7.48 kcal/mol) and Glibenclamide (-11.12 kcal/mol, -8.66 kcal/mol).

""" 39579354: Cancer cells often use alternative nutrient sources to support their metabolism and proliferation. One important alternative nutrient source for many cancers is acetate. Acetate is metabolized into acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) by acetyl-CoA synthetases 1 and 2 (ACSS1 and ACSS2), which are found in the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively. We show that ACSS1 and ACSS2 are differentially expressed in cancer. Melanoma, breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing ACSS1 readily use acetate for acetyl-CoA biosynthesis and to fuel mitochondrial metabolism. ACSS1-dependent acetate metabolism decreases the relative contributions of glucose and glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and alters the pentose phosphate pathway and redox state of cancer cells. ACSS1 knockdown decreases acute myeloid leukemia burden in vivo and inhibits melanoma tumor and metastatic growth.

""" 39956887: Depression is a long-term, related to stress neuropsychiatric disorder, leading to psychological health issues including worthlessness, anhedonia, sleep and appetite disturbances, dysregulated HPA axis, neuronal cell death, and alterations in the gut microbiota (GM). Dysregulated HPA axis increases level of glucocorticoids that induce proinflammatory response with activation of abnormal kynurenine pathway via metabolizing indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Kynurenine pathway leads to excitotoxicity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor responsible for neuronal cell death. Further, probiotics supplementation gained attention from researchers and clinicians to treat neuropsychiatric diseases. GM alteration remains a key reason for depression; however, there is limited information about the role of probiotics on depression involving glucocorticoid receptor and NMDA excitotoxicity through IDO. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was prepared to check the role of Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 9338 (LF) and 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT) in depression. Herein, mice were placed into experimental groups: control, CUMS stressed, CUMS vehicle, CUMS LF, CUMS 1-MT, and CUMS UT (untreated). Results showed that peroral administration of 1 × 108 CFU/day/mouse LF and intraperitoneal dose of 1-MT (15 mg/kg BW/day) alleviate depressive-like behavior and improve motor coordination and walking patterns. Mice supplemented with LF and 1-MT exhibited a decreased expression of GR and NMDAR2b in the cortex, hippocampus, and medulla.
