""" 21570408: Intramembrane proteases are responsible for a number of regulated proteolysis events occurring within or near the plasma and intracellular membranes. Members of one large and diverse family of putative intramembrane metalloproteases are widely distributed in all domains of life, including the type II CAAX prenyl proteases and their prokaryotic homologs with putative bacteriocin-related functions. We used sensitive sequence similarity searches to expand this large CPBP (CAAX proteases and bacteriocin-processing enzymes) family to include more than 5800 members and infer its homologous relationships to several other protein families, including the PrsW proteases, the DUF2324 (DUF, domain of unknown function) family and the γ-secretase subunit APH-1 proteins. They share four predicted core transmembrane segments and possess similar yet distinct sets of sequence motifs. Remote similarity between APH-1 and membrane proteases sheds light on APH-1's evolutionary origin and raises the possibility that APH-1 may possess proteolytic activity in the current or ancestral form of γ-secretase. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21570408/ """,
""" 37215601: The TRNT1 gene encodes tRNA nucleotidyltransferase 1, which catalyzes the addition of cytosine-cytosine-adenosine (CCA) to the ends of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs. The most common clinical phenotype associated with TRNT1 is autosomal recessive sideroblastic anemia with B-cell immunodeficiency, periodic fever, and developmental delay (SIFD). Muscle involvement has rarely been reported in TRNT1-related disorders. Here we report a Chinese patient with incomplete SIFD and hyperCKemia, and explored the skeletal muscle pathological changes. The patient was a 3-year-old boy with sensorineural hearing loss, sideroblastic anemia, and developmental delay since infancy. At the age of 11 months, significantly increased levels of creatine kinase were noted, accompanied by mild muscle weakness. Whole-exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants of the TRNT1 gene, c.443C &gt; T (p.Ala148Val) and c.692C &gt; G (p.Ala231Gly), in the patient. Western blot showed a decreased expression of TRNT1 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) in the skeletal muscle of the patient. Electron microscopy observation of skeletal muscle pathology revealed abnormal mitochondria of various sizes and shapes, supporting a diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. The present case indicates that in addition to the classic SIFD phenotype, TRNT1 mutations can cause mitochondrial myopathy, a rare clinical phenotype of TRNT1-related disorders. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37215601/ """,

Although previously believed to be uniform, there is increasing evidence that embryonic growth is influenced by the conditions and modifiable lifestyle factors of parents in the periconception period. In ongoing pregnancies, a delay in growth in the first trimester has been associated with miscarriages, malformations, low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age at birth. This has stimulated research on factors associated with variations in human embryonic growth. However, there is still no consensus on which parental conditions and modifiable lifestyle factors affect first trimester growth and development and to what extent. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39953705/ """,

""" 38841932: Background Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD) is a rare, autosomal dominant, hereditary skin disorder characterised by epidermal acantholysis. The HHD-associated gene ATPase calcium-transporting type 2C member 1 (ATP2C1) encodes the protein secretory pathway Ca2+ ATPase1 (SPCA1), playing a critical role in HHD pathogenesis. Aims We aimed to investigate the effect of ATP2C1 knockdown on keratinocytes that mimicked acantholysis in HHD. Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to evaluate the levels of cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins such as SPCA1, P-cofilin, F-actin, claudins, occludin, and zonula occludens 1 in the skin biopsies of patients with HHD. Subsequently, the expression of these proteins in cultured ATP2C1 knockdown keratinocytes was analysed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, we assessed the proliferation, apoptosis, and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in the ATP2C1-knocked keratinocytes. Results The results showed decreased levels of these proteins (SPCA1, P-cofilin, F-actin, claudins, occluding, and zonula occludens 1) in HHD skin lesions. Moreover, their levels decreased in human keratinocytes transfected with ATP2C1 short hairpin RNA, accompanied by morphological acantholysis. Furthermore, the proliferation and apoptosis of the keratinocytes, as well as intracellular calcium concentrations in these cells, were not affected. Limitations The limitations of this study are the absence of animal experiments and the failure to explore the relationship between skeletal and tight junction proteins. Conclusion The present study indicated that ATP2C1 inhibition led to abnormal levels of the cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins in the keratinocytes. Therefore, keratinocytes can mimic HHD-like acantholysis and serve as an in vitro model, helping develop treatment strategies against HHD. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38841932/ """,

This study aims to explore the link between the ABCB1 c.3435C > T genetic variation and Carbamazepine resistance and toxicity in Algerian patients with epilepsy, with a focus on the impact of genetic variations on Carbamazepine plasma concentrations and treatment outcomes. Ninety-eight Algerian patients with epilepsy were recruited and categorized as either drug-responsive or drug-resistant based on their clinical response to CBZ treatment. Genotyping of the ABCB1 c.3435 C > T polymorphism was performed using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method, and CBZ plasma levels were measured to assess its effect on metabolism. Clinical data, including drug response, therapy type, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), were collected and analyzed. For the statistical analysis we used chi-squared tests and Exact Fisher's for corrections.

""" 39952696: Eight genetically distinct families of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) have been described in organisms overall in the phylogenetic tree. They catalyze the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> to bicarbonate and protons and are involved in pH regulation, chemosensing, and metabolism. The 15 α-CA isoforms present in humans are pharmacological drug targets known for decades, their inhibitors being used as diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, or antiobesity drugs, as well as for the management of acute mountain sickness, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and recently, as antitumor theragnostic agents. Other potential applications include the use of CA inhibitors (CAIs) in inflammatory conditions, cerebral ischemia, neuropathic pain, or Alzheimer/Parkinson disease management. CAs from pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and nematodes have started to be considered as drug targets in recent years, with notable advances being registered. CAIs have a complex multipharmacology probably unique to this enzyme, which has been exploited intensely but may lead to other relevant applications in the future due to the emergence of drug design approaches that afforded highly isoform-selective compounds for most α-CAs known to date. They belong to a multitude of chemical classes (sulfonamides and isosteres, [iso]coumarins and related compounds, mono- and dithiocarbamates, selenols, ninhydrines, boronic acids, benzoxaboroles, etc). The polypharmacology of CAIs will also be discussed because drugs originally discovered for the treatment of non-CA related conditions (topiramate, zonisamide, celecoxib, pazopanib, thiazide, and high-ceiling diuretics) show effective inhibition against many CAs, which led to their repurposing for diverse pharmacological applications. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CAIs have multiple pharmacologic applications, such as diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, antiobesity, antiacute mountain sickness, anti-idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and antitumor drugs. Their use in inflammatory conditions, cerebral ischemia, neuropathic pain, or neurodegenerations has started to be investigated recently. Parasite carbonic anhydrases are also drug targets for anti-infectives with novel mechanisms of action that can bypass drug resistance to commonly used agents. Drugs discovered for the management of other conditions that effectively inhibit these enzymes exert interesting polypharmacologic effects. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39952696/ """,

""" 39920522: In women the menstrual cycle influences mood and anxiety. Aim of this study was to preliminarily investigate whether different ovarian steroid hormone levels may modulate the psychophysiological responses elicited by test anxiety. Specifically, we compared the secretion of anxiety-induced salivary proteins of healthy women in the early follicular (Pre-Ov group) (low ovarian steroid hormones levels) and mid-luteal (Post-Ov group) (medium/high ovarian steroid hormones levels) phase of the menstrual cycle, during the simulation of an oral examination. Saliva samples were collected before and after a relaxation period and at two post-simulation times and analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and western blot. Proteins corresponding to spots differentially expressed in the two groups across the session were identified through mass spectrometry and most of them corresponded to acute stress and/or oral mucosa immunity biomarkers. The task induced an increase in alpha-amylase, carbonic anhydrase and cystatin S, and a decrease in immunoglobulin light/J chains in both groups. Analogous changes in these proteins have previously been linked to psychological or physical stress. However, specific spots corresponding, for example, to cystatins and 14-3-3 protein, changed exclusively in the Pre-Ov group, while prolactin-inducible protein, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, fragments of alpha-amylase and immunoglobulins only in the Post-Ov group, indicating a potential modulation of their secretion by ovarian steroid hormones.

CAIV has been shown to play a role in sperm cell capacitation and regulation of sperm motility and is present in mature murine placentae. The present study specifically analyses the distribution of CAIV in female reproductive organs and during early placenta development. Immunostaining for CAIV was performed on female reproductive organs (ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, vagina) of non-pregnant mice and on implantation sites of early pregnancy between 4.5 and 9.5 days post coitum (dpc). Sex typing of embryos was performed by PCR using three separated gene combinations for X- and Y-chromosomes, respectively. Additionally, reproductive outcome of CAIV-deficient mice was determined. CAIV is largely absent in the female reproductive organs of non-pregnant mice. Immunostaining for CAIV was present in the blastocyst and in consecutive stages of the developing embryo. In the endometrial epithelium distant from the implantation chamber, CAIV is induced from 8.5 dpc onwards. Moreover, the yolk sac epithelium, the trophoblast giant cells and the labyrinthine compartment of the developing hemochorial placenta shows a strong immunostaining for CAIV. In heterozygous mating, the number of CAIV knockout pups is significantly reduced than was to be expected according to the mendelian rules, while homozygous mating of CAIV knockout mice results in a significant reduction of litter size which is mainly due to a reduced number of female mice born. Since at 9.5 dpc the number of female embryos is rather higher than that of males, the observed reduction of female offspring appears to be due to a defect in placentation after 9.5 dpc. Thus, CAIV seems to be involved in the signaling network of embryo development, implantation, and placentation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39908001/ """,

""" 36927842: SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Thiazide diuretics (thiazides) are among the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, but their use is associated with glucose intolerance and new-onset diabetes mellitus. The molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our study reveals that thiazides attenuate insulin secretion through inhibition of the mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase isoform 5b (CA5b) in pancreatic β cells. We furthermore discovered that pancreatic β cells express only one functional carbonic anhydrase isoform, CA5b, which is critical in replenishing oxaloacetate in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). These findings explain the mechanism for thiazide-induced glucose intolerance and reveal a fundamental role of CA5b in TCA cycle anaplerosis and insulin secretion in β cells. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36927842/ """,

Inhibition of insulin secretion by thiazides was CO 2 /HCO 3- -dependent, not additive to unselective CA inhibition with acetazolamide, and independent of extracellular potassium. By contrast, insulin secretion was unaltered in islets of mice lacking the known molecular thiazide targets NCC or NDCBE. CA expression profiling with subsequent knockdown of individual CA isoforms suggested mitochondrial CA5b as a molecular target.

""" 39952159: Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity, associated with Photosystem II (PSII), has been shown to enhance water oxidation. However, CA activity was thought to be a side effect or even a contamination of other CAs because of the relatively low rates of CA reactions in PSII measured previously. Here, by using 8-hydroxy-pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (pyranine), a fluorescent dye, as a pH indicator, we show that PSII preparations (∗∗BBYs) from Pisum sativum have a high CA activity (as measured by HCO<sub>3</sub>- dehydration), which is close to that of highly active CAs. This fluorescence method is new for BBYs giving at least ten times higher activity than the other methods used earlier, as well as being highly sensitive and, thus, more convenient to use for BBYs than any other approach. We show here that the pH range of 5.0-7.5 is optimum for the pyranine measuring system, in general, and this pH range is suitable not only for the CA in BBYs but also for other CAs. Further, the CA activity of BBYs has the following unique properties: (1) low sensitivity to some known, and otherwise, effective CA inhibitors; (2) an opposite pH profile of HCO<sub>3</sub>- dehydration than observed in other known CAs. These findings indicate that the high CA activity, we have observed, belongs to BBYs, i.e., free of other CAs. At pH 6.5, CA activity of BBYs is shown to be directly correlated with that of photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution.

Among potential targets for molecular imaging reporters, Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) stands out for its overexpression in tumors characterized by large hypoxic areas and aggressive phenotypes. CAIX, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in pH regulation, displays a unique proteoglycan-like (PG) domain, not present in other isoforms, that could represent a specific target for imaging and therapy. While high sensitivity imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and optical imaging have been applied for CAIX targeting, no in vivo study utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to target CAIX has yet been reported. Herein, we address this gap by applying CAIX PG-targeting functionalized liposomes in the first in vivo MRI study on a murine model of breast cancer. TS/A cells were subcutaneously injected to generate primary tumors in mice, and targeted liposomes were delivered intravenously after 15 days. Internalization of the targeted liposomes by receptor-mediated endocytosis led to an enhanced MRI signal in the tumor region. Cytoplasmic and endosomal distribution of the liposomes' payload was observed. Conversely, non-functionalized liposomes and liposomes bearing a scrambled peptide, while entering tumor cells in smaller amounts, localized only to endosomes as expected.

Targeted drugs have been used for anti-liver cancer treatment in the advanced stage, while their efficacy is greatly compromised by development of drug resistance. Drug resistance is a complicated process regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals and has been associated with poorer prognosis in cancer patients. In the current study, online available dataset analysis uncovered that angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) manifested lower expression in sorafenib-resistant liver cancer cell lines. Additionally, ANGPTL3 was downregulated in HCC tissues, with its expression positively correlated with good prognosis. Functionally, ectopic expression of ANGPTL3 re-sensitized sorafenib-resistant cells, enhancing the sorafenib-induced reduction in cell viability and migration by suppressing zinc finger protein SNAI1 (SNAI1) expression and the protein stability of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1, liver isoform (CPT1A). Clinical correlation analysis revealed that ANGPTL3 was negatively associated with SNAI1 expression.

""" 39781464: Dysregulated energy metabolism, particularly lipid metabolism disorders, has been identified as a key factor in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is a deacetylase involved in the regulation of metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis, yet its role in the progression of DCM remains unclear. We observed significantly reduced SIRT2 expression in DCM model mice. Cardiac-specific overexpression of SIRT2 protected mice from streptozotocin/high-fat diet (STZ/HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR), cell apoptosis, and cardiac dysfunction, whereas its downregulation exacerbated these conditions. Moreover, we found that SIRT2 regulated cardiac lipid accumulation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and identified its localization in cardiac mitochondria. Mechanistically, we determined carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) as a critical substrate of SIRT2, which is implicated in DCM. SIRT2-mediated deacetylation at K239 enhanced CPT2 ubiquitination, resulting in decreased protein stability and subsequent inhibition of FAO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

The effect of rs737865 on functional movement was evaluated using general linear models, while associations between trauma and functional movement were determined with regression models. An alpha level of 0.05 was set as the threshold for significance. In the standard three-genotype model (GG, AG, AA), rs737865 predicted functional movement (p = 0.03, η2p = 0.05). Specifically, GG (n = 9) exhibited the highest functional movement scores (mean [M] ± standard deviation [SD] = 17.2±1.9), followed by AG (n = 45; M±SD = 15.9±2.5), and then AA (n = 80; M±SD = 15.2±2.3).

In this study, we systematically investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of PFAS mixtures on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells (JHH-7 and Li-7) in vitro using a combination of biological techniques and high-coverage untargeted metabolomics. A six day exposure to a 5 μM PFAS mixture significantly enhanced the malignant progression of HCC in vitro. Metabolomic analysis identified the upregulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a key factor associated with these effects. This hypothesis was further validated using celecoxib, a PGE2 inhibitor, which reduced PGE2 levels in HCC cells, consequently slowing their migration and invasion. Additionally, mice treated with celecoxib exhibited reduced tumor volumes compared with those treated with PFAS alone. These results suggest that PFAS exposure enhances HCC malignancy through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via increased PGE2 production.

""" 39931565: Iron uptake in the intestinal epithelium is associated with transport of ferrous iron via the DMT1 transporter (SLC11a2; NRAMP2). In later years, uptake of iron from complex sources, such as nanoparticles, has been found to be mediated through endocytosis. Here we propose that iron from the simple salt ferrous fumarate, a common iron supplement, can be absorbed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We used siRNA to silence DMT1 transporter expression, pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis, and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to show that iron uptake from ferrous fumarate can be mediated by both transport via DMT1 and by clathrin-dependent endocytosis in Hutu-80 cells. Iron uptake (ferritin L) from ferrous fumarate (0.5 mM, 24 h) in DMT1 silenced cells was significantly decreased (60% ± 11%) in comparison to iron controls while a 1-h dose of ferrous fumarate (0.5 mM) significantly decreased ferritin L formation in the presence of the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine (61% ± 10%, in post-confluent cells and 37% ± 9% in non-confluent cells). A pilot showed a similar trend for Ferritin (H) levels (confluent cells) and for total cellular iron load (non-confluent cells). ToF-SIMS analysis revealed diminished membrane-associated iron load in endocytosis-inhibited ferrous fumarate treated cells.

""" 39751793: Cholesterol is vital for nerve processes. Changes in cholesterol homeostasis lead to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, extensive research has confirmed the influential role of adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in managing AD. The present study aims is to investigate a new approach concerning AD by MSCs with particular reference to the cholesterol homeostasis pathway and its regulatory miRNAs in an AD-like rat model. Three groups of 24 male Wistar rats have been divided: healthy rats (control), Alzheimer's rats (AD), and Alzheimer's rats that received MSCs (AD + MSC). Cholesterol level was measured using the GC-mass technique. The mRNA and expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), apolipoprotein E (APOE), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and CYP46A1 genes, as well as their regulating miRNAs, were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting techniques, respectively. Intraventricular transplantation of MSCs improved behavioral disorders and decreased the count of Aβ plaques in brain tissue. Transplantation of these cells also led to a significant decrease in cholesterol levels and HMGCR, ApoE, and ABCA1 and a remarkable increase in CYP46A1 mRNAs and protein expression. These cells considerably changed the expression of microRNAs regulating these genes. These results indicated that the examined miRNAs could be used as promising biomarkers for AD management.

""" 39908632: Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are potential pandemic of global concern, posing a major threat to both the poultry industry and human health. Host factors play a key role in the replication of AIVs, while the function of complement component 4 binding protein, membrane (C4BPM) in this process is still unclear. This research reports that C4BPM promotes replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs by inhibiting type I interferons (IFNs). H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs infection up-regulate the expression of C4BPM in chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1). To verify the role of C4BPM in replication of AIVs, C4BPM knockout (C4BPM-KO) and stable overexpressing (C4BPM-overexpressing) DF-1 cells were generated using lentivirus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology and molecular cloning strategies. Replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs were promoted in C4BPM-overexpressing DF-1 cells with inhibited expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α, IFN-β), protein kinase R (PKR), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) compared to that of the DF-1 cells. However, the replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs in C4BPM-KO DF-1 cells were inhibited with the increased expression of above related anti-viral factors. Further results showed that C4BPM did not affect viral adsorption, while, promote the entry of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs.

Surveillance: Kidneys and urinary tract: In the absence of known structural abnormalities, kidney and bladder ultrasound examination 12 months after establishing the diagnosis, then every two to three years in childhood/adolescence, then every three to five years in adulthood; presence of an abnormality may warrant more frequent monitoring. Monitor blood pressure, kidney function, serum concentration of magnesium, potassium, uric acid, urine magnesium, creatinine, and protein-to-creatinine ratio with frequency per nephrologist; more frequent monitoring may be advised in those with lab findings of kidney disease, those who are taking potentially nephrotoxic medications, and/or those with genitourinary structural abnormalities. Assess developmental progress and educational needs at each visit throughout childhood and adolescence; assess for features of ASD and ADHD at each visit in early childhood; full psychoeducational evaluation for children who experience difficulty with school or behavioral changes; assess for prodromal psychotic symptoms and bipolar disorder at each visit in adolescence. Annual hemoglobin A1c; educate individuals and their families for clinical signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus. Consider reevaluation for uterine and vaginal abnormalities related to müllerian duct aplasia in pubertal females with primary amenorrhea. Hepatic function panel and GGT periodically; consider periodic lipid panel. Annual serum calcium and phosphorus to assess for hyperparathyroidism; annual ophthalmologic evaluation during early childhood. Fecal elastase-1 to test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in individuals with suggestive signs and symptoms. Monitor those with seizures as clinically indicated. Hearing screening throughout childhood. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Because kidney transplantation increases the risk for post-transplant diabetes mellitus, an immunosuppressive regimen that avoids tacrolimus and mTOR inhibitors and reduces corticosteroid exposure may benefit those without preexisting diabetes mellitus. Nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided by individuals with kidney or liver abnormalities. For individuals with mental health conditions (e.g., ASD, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder), careful consideration of antipsychotic agents that may lead to weight gain, as this may lead to metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, for which individuals with 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome are at increased risk.

The research progress of CF gene modification has led to the innovation of CF treatment. However, the sweat test as an important test for the diagnosis of CF has not been widely implemented in China. At present, the diagnosis and treatment of CF in China still lacks standardized recommendations. In view of these updates, the Chinese Experts Cystic Fibrosis Consensus Committee has formed the Chinese experts consensus statement: diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis based on extensive opinion gathering, literatures review, multiple meetings and discussions. This consensus collects 38 core issues related to CF, including pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and patient management. Finally, 32 recommendations were formulated. The consensus used the modified GRADE methodology to grade the evidence evaluation and recommendations. This is the current state of CF consensus in China, and we hope to improve the diagnosis and treatment of CF in China in the future.Summary of recommendationsQuestion 1: How can CF be identified?CF should be suspected if there is: (1) a family history of CF; (2) delayed meconium expulsion or meconium ileus; (3) pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, mainly characterized by long-standing steatorrhea and malnutrition; (4) recurrent lower respiratory tract infections of infantile onset, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus infections of respiratory aetiology; (5) chronic sinusitis, especially when combined with juvenile presentation of nasal polyps; (6) chest CT abnormalities such as the presence of air trapping, bronchiectasis (upper lobe predominant); (7) pseudo-Bartter syndrome; (8) absence of vas deferens in males; (9) clubbing in young bronchiectasis patients(1C).Question 2: What are the diagnostic criteria for CF?1.1 Presence of one or more of the characteristic clinical manifestations or family history consistent with CF, and meeting at least one of the following definite diagnostic criteria in 1.2 or 1.3.1.2 Sweat chloride testing:(1) Concentrations of more than 60 mmol/L are diagnostic; (2) concentrations between 30-59 mmol/L are intermediate, and genetic variation must be considered to confirm the diagnosis; (3) concentrations less than 30 mmol/L are considered normal.1.3 Genetic testing:(1) Detection of two disease-causing CFTR(cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) mutations on biallelic alleles; (2) The CFTR variants are of undetermined significance, but tests such as sweat chloride concentration, intestinal current measurement, or nasal mucosal potential difference suggest abnormal CFTR function, then CF is diagnostic(1C).Question 3: What is the diagnostic process for CF arranged?Sweat chloride testing and CFTR gene analysis are recommended in all patients suspected of CF(1D).Question 4: What is the value of sweat chloride testing in the diagnosis of CF?Sweat chloride testing is the gold standard for the clinical diagnosis of CF(1C).Question 5: What is the value of CFTR genetic testing in Chinese CF diagnosis?Biallelic pathogenic variants of CFTR are a definitive diagnosis of CF(1D).Question 6: What is the diagnostic value of imaging for CF?Chest CT is a sensitive test for early stages of lung disease in patients with CF and is appropriate in younger patients and to assess disease progression.

""" 37379306: Chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 3B (CELA3B, elastase-3B) is a pancreatic enzyme with digestive function in the intestine. Since RNA analyses of normal tissues suggest that CELA3B expression is limited to the pancreas, the potential diagnostic utility of CELA3B immunohistochemistry for the distinction of pancreatic from extrapancreatic cancers and in the distinction of acinar cell carcinoma from ductal adenocarcinoma was assessed. CELA3B expression was successfully analyzed in 13,223 tumor samples from 132 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 8 samples each of 76 different normal tissue types by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format (TMA). In normal tissues, CELA3B immunostaining was only seen in acinar cells and in a fraction of ductal cells of the pancreas as well as on some apical membranes of surface epithelial cells of the intestine. Among tumors, CELA3B immunostaining was seen in 12 of 16 (75%) acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas including 6 cases with strong staining (37.5%) as well as in 5 of 13,207 other tumors (0.04%). These included 1.2% of 91 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 1.2% of 246 mucoepidermoid carcinomas and 0.8% of 127 acinic cell carcinomas of salivary glands. Our data show a good sensitivity (75%) and a high specificity (99.9%) of CELA3B immunohistochemistry for diagnosing acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37379306/ """,
""" 38981616: The serine protease chymotrypsin protects the pancreas against pancreatitis by degrading trypsinogen, the precursor to the digestive protease trypsin. Taking advantage of previously generated mouse models with either the Ctrb1 gene (encoding chymotrypsin B1) or the Ctrl gene (encoding chymotrypsin-like protease) disrupted, here we generated the novel Ctrb1-del × Ctrl-KO strain in the C57BL/6N genetic background, which harbors a naturally inactivated Ctrc gene (encoding chymotrypsin C). The newly created mice are devoid of chymotrypsin, yet the animals develop normally, breed well, and show no spontaneous phenotype, indicating that chymotrypsin is dispensable under laboratory conditions. When given cerulein, the Ctrb1-del × Ctrl-KO strain exhibited markedly increased intrapancreatic trypsin activation and more severe acute pancreatitis, relative to wild-type C57BL/6N mice. After the acute episode, Ctrb1-del × Ctrl-KO mice spontaneously progressed to chronic pancreatitis, whereas C57BL/6N mice recovered rapidly. The cerulein-induced pancreas pathology in Ctrb1-del × Ctrl-KO mice was highly similar to that previously observed in Ctrb1-del mice; however, trypsin activation was more robust and pancreatitis severity was increased. Taken together, the results confirm and extend prior observations demonstrating that chymotrypsin safeguards the pancreas against pancreatitis by limiting pathologic trypsin activity. In mice, the CTRB1 isoform, which constitutes about 90% of the total chymotrypsin content, is responsible primarily for the anti-trypsin defenses and protection against pancreatitis; however, the minor isoform CTRL also contributes to an appreciable extent.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Chymotrypsins defend the pancreas against the inflammatory disorder pancreatitis by degrading harmful trypsinogen. This study demonstrates that mice devoid of pancreatic chymotrypsins are phenotypically normal but become sensitized to secretagogue hyperstimulation and exhibit increased intrapancreatic trypsin activation, more severe acute pancreatitis, and rapid progression to chronic pancreatitis. The observations confirm and extend the essential role of chymotrypsins in pancreas health. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38981616/ """,
""" 39932323: UNLABELLED: Identifying resistance mechanisms to novel antimicrobials informs treatment strategies during infection and antimicrobial development. Studying resistance that develops during the treatment of an infection can provide the most clinically relevant mutations conferring resistance, but cross-sectional studies frequently identify multiple candidate resistance mutations without resolving the driver mutation. We performed whole-genome sequencing of longitudinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a patient whose P. aeruginosa developed imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance during ceftazidime/avibactam treatment. This analysis determined new mutations that arose in isolates resistant to both imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam. Mutations in penicillin-binding protein 3 ftsI, the MexAB-OprM repressor nalD, and a virulence regulator pvdS were found in resistant isolates. Importantly, drug efflux was not increased in the resistant isolate compared to the most closely related susceptible isolates. We conclude that mutations in peptidoglycan synthesis genes can alter the efficacy of multiple antimicrobials. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39932323/ """,
""" 39932323: IMPORTANCE: Antibiotic resistance is a significant challenge for physicians trying to treat infections. The development of novel antibiotics to treat resistant infections has not been prioritized for decades, limiting treatment options for infections caused by many high-priority pathogens. Cross-resistance, when one mutation provides resistance to multiple antibiotics, is most problematic. Mutations that cause cross-resistance need to be considered when developing new antibiotics to guide developers toward drugs with different targets, and thus a better likelihood of efficacy. This work was undertaken to determine the mutation that caused resistance to three antibiotics for highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection treatment while the bacteria were exposed to only one of these agents. The findings provide evidence that drug developers should endeavor to find effective antibiotics with new targets and that medical providers should utilize medications with different mechanisms of action in bacteria that have become resistant to even one of these three agents. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39932323/ """,
