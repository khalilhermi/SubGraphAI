Previous studies have shown that the damage of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cell (BM EPC) hinders haematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy in mice. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanism and repair strategy of chemotherapy-induced BM EPC damage is urgent needed. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39914998/ """,
""" 39914998: METHODS: The prospective case-control study enrolled 40 AML patients after CR (CR patients), who received idarubicin and cytarabine (IA) regimen (n = 20), or homoharringtonine, aclarubicin and cytarabine (HAA) regimen (n = 20) as induction chemotherapy, and their age-matched healthy controls (HCs, n = 20). The HSPG2 expression level in BM EPCs and BM plasma were determined via flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The BM EPC's functions were evaluated by apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, migration and tube formation assays. The haematopoiesis-supporting ability and leukaemia cell-supporting ability of BM EPCs were assessed through coculture assay. Moreover, RNA sequencing and qPCR were performed to further explore the underlying mechanism. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39914998/ """,

Moreover, the BM EPC's functions of CR patients were reduced. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the HSPG2 gene knockdown or cytosine arabinoside treatment led to BM EPC dysfunction, whereas the HSPG2 treatment promoted repair of the BM EPC function in vitro. In addition, we found that the HSPG2 treatment restored the BM EPC function from CR patients without affecting their leukaemia cell-supporting ability.

""" 39674082: Despite the vital role of iron and vulnerability of iron metabolism in disease states, it remains largely unknown whether chemicals interacting with cellular proteins are responsible for perturbation of iron metabolism. We previously demonstrated that cisplatin was an inhibitor of the iron regulatory system by blocking IRP2 (iron regulatory protein 2) binding to an iron-responsive element (IRE) located in the 3'- or 5'-UTR (untranslated region) of key iron metabolism genes such as transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferritin mRNAs. To guide the development of new chemical probes to modulate the IRP-IRE regulatory system, we used an artificial intelligence (AI)-based ligand design and screened a chemical library composed of cysteine-reactive warheads. Using wild type and mutant IRE-luciferase reporter cells, we identified new IRP-IRE inhibitors such as V004-0872 harboring chloroacetamide, while its analog V011-6261 with chloropropanamide completely lost the inhibitory activity. V004-0872 inhibited the human IRP2 via Cys512 and caused decreased iron levels through reciprocal TfR1 downregulation and ferritin upregulation. V004-0872 increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exhibited cytotoxicity that was inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine but not the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1. Furthermore, we found that widely used haloketone protease inhibitors and acetamide herbicides inhibit the IRP-IRE system. Since IRP2 overexpression is responsible for iron excess conditions to promote growth of several cancers and exacerbation of iron-overload diseases, these results and new compounds lay the groundwork for new reagents and strategies to limit the availability of iron and oxidative stress in iron-overloaded disease conditions. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39674082/ """,

""" 39802101: βPix is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rac1 and Cdc42 small GTPases, which play important roles in dendritic spine morphogenesis by modulating actin cytoskeleton organization. The formation and plasticity of the dendritic spines are essential for normal brain function. Among the alternatively spliced βPix isoforms, βPix-b and βPix-d are expressed specifically in neurons. Our previous studies using cultured hippocampal neurons identified the roles of βPix-b and βPix-d in spine formation and neurite development, respectively. Here, we analyzed the in vivo role of the neuronal βPix isoforms in brain development and function by using βPix neuronal isoform knockout (βPix-NIKO) mice, in which the expression of the βPix-b and βPix-d isoforms is blocked, while the expression of the ubiquitous βPix-a isoform is maintained. Loss of the neuronal βPix isoforms leads to reduced activity of Rac1 and Cdc42, decreased dendritic complexity and spine density, and increased GluN2B and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα expression in the hippocampus. The defects in neurite development, dendritic spine maturation, and synaptic density in cultured βPix-NIKO hippocampal neurons were rescued by the expression of βPix-b or βPix-d. In behavioral studies, βPix-NIKO mice exhibited robust deficits in novel object recognition and decreased anxiety levels. Our findings suggest that neuronal morphogenetic signaling by the neuronal βPix isoforms contributes to normal behaviors. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39802101/ """,
""" 39682250: Background: Anemia is a common and progressive clinical manifestation of myelofibrosis that may occur as part of the disease pathogenesis as well as due to the myelosuppressive effects of some treatments, with a substantial impact on quality of life, prognosis, and healthcare resource utilization. Despite these burdens, anemia management has traditionally been a secondary priority to spleen and symptom control, due in part to the limitations of available therapeutic approaches. With the initial regulatory approvals of momelotinib, a Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2, and activin A receptor type 1 inhibitor that provides anemia-related benefits in addition to addressing splenomegaly and symptoms, re-evaluation of anemia as an early and prominent treatment consideration is warranted. Methods: In this review, we discuss the journey of patients with myelofibrosis and anemia across various severities and clinical scenarios. Results: Summarized are traditional approaches to anemia management and the clinical trial efficacy and safety data that support momelotinib as an option in each setting from mild to severe anemia, including in the context of co-occurring thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: With the availability of momelotinib and other emerging therapies directed at anemia control, early treatment of anemia to avoid progression and support improvement in eligible patients with myelofibrosis should be a primary consideration. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39682250/ """,
""" 20301525: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by the presence of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that lack intervening capillaries and result in direct connections between arteries and veins. The most common clinical manifestation is spontaneous and recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis) beginning on average at age 12 years. Telangiectases (small AVMs) are characteristically found on the lips, tongue, buccal and gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, face, and fingers. The appearance of telangiectases is generally later than epistaxis but may be during childhood. Large AVMs occur most often in the lungs, liver, or brain; complications from bleeding or shunting may be sudden and catastrophic. A minority of individuals with HHT have GI bleeding, which is rarely seen before age 50 years. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301525/ """,

Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301525/ """,
""" 20301525: MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Nosebleeds are treated with humidification, topical moisturizing therapy, hemostatic products, antifibrinolytic therapy, ablation therapy, systemic antiangiogenic agents, septodermoplasty, and nasal closure as needed. GI bleeding and anemia is treated with iron replacement therapy and (if needed) blood transfusions and antiangiogenic agents. Pulmonary AVMs with a feeding vessel 1-2 mm or greater in diameter typically require occlusion for stroke prevention. When pulmonary shunting is present, use antibiotic prophylaxis for dental and non-sterile invasive procedures, taking care to prevent air bubbles from being introduced in intravenous lines. This may include an air filter when available and compatible with the medication being administered. Treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension as per cardiologist, pulmonologist, and other relevant specialists. Symptomatic hepatic AVMs are managed medically; liver transplantation is recommended for individuals who do not respond to medical therapy and who develop high-output heart failure. Cerebral AVMs are treated as indicated by size, location, or symptoms: by surgery, embolotherapy, and/or stereotactic radiosurgery. Gastrointestinal polyps are treated according to guidelines for juvenile polyposis syndrome. Surveillance: Annual evaluation by a health care provider familiar with HHT for signs and symptoms of complications; annual hematocrit, hemoglobin, and ferritin; evaluation for pulmonary AVMs every five years with transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TCE) in adults, TCE or chest radiograph with pulse oximetry in children; brain MRI with and without contrast using sequences that detect blood products in infancy and again after puberty for cerebral AVMs; colonoscopy at age 15 years and repeated every three years if no polyps are found, or annually with esophagogastroduodenoscopy if colonic polyps are identified in those with SMAD4-HHT. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vigorous nose blowing; lifting heavy objects; straining during bowel movements; finger manipulation in the nose; anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory agents (including aspirin) in individuals with significant nose or GI bleeding; scuba diving unless TCE within the last five years was negative for evidence of a right-to-left shunt; liver biopsy. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing is offered to at-risk family members if the germline pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, at-risk family members should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of HHT, and screening should be offered to at-risk family members if the diagnosis cannot be ruled out. Pregnancy management: Women with HHT considering pregnancy are screened and treated for pulmonary and cerebral AVMs; sizable pulmonary AVMs discovered during pregnancy are treated during the second trimester.

""" 39544188: The aim of this meta-analysis was to analyze allele and genotype pattern frequencies of five different gene polymorphisms associated with endurance athlete status. Endurance sports require prolonged physical performance, and it is well known that physiological and genetic characteristics play a prominent role in this performance. In recent years, research on the impact of genetic factors on endurance athlete status has been on the rise, suggesting that various gene polymorphisms may be associated with physical performance. Specifically, the gene polymorphisms, activin receptor type-1B (A9CVR1B) rs2854464, angiotensinogen (AGT) rs699, fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) rs9939609, interleukin-6 (IL-6) rs1800795, and nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NRF2) rs12594956, are thought to be related to endurance athlete status. Each of these genes plays a part in different biological processes, such as muscle development, energy metabolism, inflammation, and antioxidant defense mechanisms. For example, the NRF2 gene is a critical player in the regulation of cellular stress responses and may contribute to adaptive responses that enhance performance in endurance athletes. This meta-analysis included a total of 20 articles published between 2009 and 2023. The specific gene polymorphisms explored in this study, i.e., ACVR1B rs2854464, AGT rs699, FTO rs9939609, IL-6 rs1800795, and NRF2 rs12594956, were selected due to their reported associations with physical performance and endurance. A comprehensive search was conducted in the Web of Science and PubMed databases using specific keywords, preliminarily identifying 329 articles. Upon analysis of the abstracts, and full texts, 20 articles were deemed eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Articles lacking control and endurance athlete groups or clear allele/genotype data were excluded. The findings indicated no significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies for ACVR1B, AGT, FTO, and IL-6 gene polymorphisms between endurance athletes and control groups. However, the NRF2 rs12594956 gene polymorphism showed a significantly higher frequency of the major allele (A) and the AA genotype in endurance athletes than in controls. In conclusion, the NRF2 rs12594956 polymorphism may be a genetic variant of interest in determining the status of endurance athletes.

""" 39254854: Human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have significant applications in reproductive medicine and regenerative medicine because of their great plasticity. Nevertheless, it remains unknown about the functions and mechanisms of long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) in regulating the fate determinations of human SSCs. Here we have demonstrated that LncRNA ACVR2B-as1 (activin A receptor type 2B antisense RNA 1) controls the self-renewal and apoptosis of human SSCs by interaction with ALDOA via glycolysis activity. LncRNA ACVR2B-as1 is highly expressed in human SSCs. LncRNA ACVR2B-as1 silencing suppresses the proliferation and DNA synthesis and enhances the apoptosis of human SSCs. Mechanistically, our ChIRP-MS and RIP assays revealed that ACVR2B-as1 interacted with ALDOA in human SSCs. High expression of ACVR2B-as1 enhanced the proliferation, DNA synthesis, and glycolysis of human SSCs but inhibited their apoptosis through up-regulation of ALDOA. Importantly, overexpression of ALDOA counteracted the effect of ACVR2B-as1 knockdown on the aforementioned biological processes. Collectively, these results indicate that ACVR2B-as1 interacts with ALDOA to control the self-renewal and apoptosis of human SSCs by enhancing glycolysis activity. This study is of great significance because it sheds a novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the fate decisions of human SSCs and it may offer innovative approaches to address the etiology of male infertility. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39254854/ """,

As a key regulator of protein N-terminal acetylation, APEH was involved in many important physiological processes while its aberrant expression was correlated with progression of various diseases such as inflammation, diabetics, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cancers. However, while emerging attention has been attracted in APEH-related disease diagnosis and drug discovery, the mechanisms behind APEH and related disease progression are still unclear; thus, further investigating the physiological role and function of APEH is of great importance. To date, enzyme-activated fluorescent probes targeting POPs have been extensively reported and adopted in relevant medical research and applications. Nevertheless, as an important member of the POP family, APEH was rarely referred in the field of bioimaging while the fluorescent probe for in vivo sensing of APEH activity has not been reported yet. Thus, acquiring an efficient APEH-targeted probe is in urgent need. Herein, an enzyme-activated fluorogenic probe for in vivo profiling of APEH was first discovered via a substrate mimic-based strategy. By combination of stimulated molecular docking-based preliminary screening and experiment-based secondary screening, the optimal probe (named as TMN-AcA), which displayed high binding affinity, sensitivity, and specificity toward APEH, was screened out. Owing to the superior properties of TMN-AcA, endogenous APEH activity in various cell lines and transplanted tumor could be visualized while tissue distribution of APEH was revealed. Most importantly, APEH was first demonstrated to be a potential biomarker of multiple-organ injury via TMN-AcA-based bioimaging and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis while the newly developed probe could serve as a vital tool for APEH-related disease diagnosis and biological function study. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39862163/ """,

Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) is expressed in various phagocytes and is highly expressed in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). Research shows that AOAH plays a critical role in infections and chronic inflammatory diseases, although its role in kidney injury is unknown. Here, we found that AOAH deletion led to exacerbated kidney injury and fibrosis after folic acid (FA) administration, which was reversed by overexpression of Aoah in kidneys. ScRNA-seq revealed that Aoah-/- mice exhibited increased subpopulation of CD74+ PTECs, though the percentage of total PTECs were decreased compared to WT mice after FA treatment. Additionally, exacerbated kidney injury and fibrosis seen in Aoah-/- mice was attenuated via administration of methyl ester of (S, R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid (ISO-1), an inhibitor of macrophage inhibition factor (MIF) and CD74 binding. Finally, AOAH expression was found positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate while negatively correlated with the degree of renal fibrosis in kidneys of CKD patients.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, has demonstrated anti-tumor effects against several types of cancers; however, studies examining its potential impact on cholangiocarcinoma are lacking. This study investigated the anti-tumor effects of canagliflozin on cholangiocarcinoma and the effects of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ salvage pathway activation and sirtuin 1 on tumor growth. We evaluated cell proliferation and gene expression in several cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and analyzed the effects of canagliflozin on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. Canagliflozin treatment decreased the viability of cholangiocarcinoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner but increased the viability at low concentrations in several cell lines. At high concentrations, canagliflozin arrested the cell cycle checkpoint in the G0/G1 phase. In contrast, at low concentrations, it increased the proportion of cells in the S phase. Canagliflozin also reduced the migratory ability of cholangiocarcinoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Canagliflozin treatment upregulated nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), NAD+, and sirtuin 1 in cholangiocarcinoma and activated the NAD+ salvage pathway. The growth-inhibitory effect of canagliflozin was enhanced when combined with an NAMPT inhibitor. Canagliflozin inhibits cholangiocarcinoma cell growth and migration and its anti-tumor effect is enhanced when combined with an NAMPT inhibitor.

""" 39953803: Overconsumption of fructose is linked to metabolic diseases, which are often associated with reduced fertility. GLUT5 is the most specific fructose transporter. To investigate its role in the testes, we analyzed the male reproductive phenotype of transgenic male mice deficient in GLUT5 (GLUT5-/- or GLUT5 knockout [KO] mice). Glut5 expression was shown in Leydig cells and germ cells, from primary spermatocytes to spermatozoa. We found reduced intratesticular fructose and pyruvate concentrations in GLUT5-/- mice. These mice exhibited 30% lower litter sizes compared with control mice. Histological analysis of the testes revealed some seminiferous tubules with a Sertoli cell-only phenotype, although spermatogenesis occurred normally in most tubules. Reduced fertility in GLUT5 KO mice was linked to lower sperm production and impaired sperm quality. Spermatozoa from these mice displayed reduced motility, head abnormalities, and a diminished acrosome reaction, which was associated with reduced cyclic adenosine monophosphate content and impaired phosphorylation of protein kinase A substrates in the acrosome. Unexpectedly, androgen production in GLUT5 KO mice was 3-fold higher than in controls, despite unchanged luteinizing hormone levels. Electron microscopy of Leydig cells revealed a highly developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, increased lipid droplets, and abnormal mitochondrial structures, suggesting disrupted mitochondrial dynamics. Proteomic analysis identified 155 deregulated proteins in the testicular tissue of GLUT5 KO mice, nearly half of which were associated with sperm motility, germ cell morphology, glycolysis, mitochondrial dynamics, and oxidative stress.

Our experiments both in vivo and in vitro revealed that DJ-1 enhanced the malignant characteristics of KIRC, leading to increased tumor growth. Additionally, DJ-1 inhibited ferroptosis through promoting homocysteine (Hcy) synthesis in the transsulfuration pathway in KIRC cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) mediated O-GlcNAcylation of DJ-1 was crucial for maintaining its homodimeric structure. Importantly, O-GlcNAcylation-deficient mutation of DJ-1 at T19 residue enhanced the interaction between S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and the negative regulatory factor S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase-like-1 (AHCYL1), thereby inhibited the activities of SAHH and transsulfuration pathway. In summary, the oncogenic role of DJ-1 in KIRC was closely related to the reduction of ferroptosis, and the O-GlcNAcylation of DJ-1 exerted an antioxidant effect by activating the transsulfuration pathway. Therefore, DJ-1, specifically O-GlcNAcylation of DJ-1 could represent an important target for ferroptosis-based anti-tumor therapy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39842141/ """,

Single and three-day administration of TPY3m (i.p., 20 mg/kg) was studied, and the effect of TPY3m on the HPT axis was compared with that of levothyroxine. TPY3m increased TH levels when administered to both healthy and diabetic rats, normalizing thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels in T2DM and, unlike levothyroxine, without negatively affecting TSH levels or the expression of hypothalamic and pituitary genes responsible for TSH production. TPY3m pretreatment preserved the stimulatory effects of TRH on TH levels and thyroid gene expression. This indicates the absence of competition between TPY3m and endogenous TSH for TSH receptor activation and is supported by our in vitro results on TPY3m- and TSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat thyroid membranes. Morphological analysis of thyroid glands in diabetic rats after three-day TPY3m administration shows an increase in its functional activity without destructive changes.

This study aimed to investigate the receptor genes associated with glutamate (Glu) repeat polymorphism sites Glu12 and Glu9 in the α2B-AR gene. A total of 50 patients with vasodepressor-type (VT)-NMS and 20 healthy volunteers were included in this study. We assessed AC activity levels and blood pressure responses during the head-up tilt (HUT) test and conducted a Glu repeat polymorphism analysis to explore its potential association with NMS. Our findings showed significantly higher AC activity in patients with the Glu12/12 homotype than healthy volunteers across all four HUT test points. Conversely, patients with the Glu9/12 heterotype exhibited a significant difference only 10 min after the test initiation, suggesting a pronounced activation effect of the β2-AR Gs-α subunit in these individuals. Both genotypes displayed the greatest blood pressure fluctuations under 70° tilt stress, with patients with Glu12/12 showing consistent cardiac load and higher values than those with Glu9/12 at two points. Notably, the frequency of NMS onset within 20 min during the tilt test varied, with one Glu12/12 patient and seven Glu9/12 patients experiencing syncope. Additionally, patients with the Glu9/12 heterotype were found to have a higher risk of syncope after prolonged standing compared to those with the Glu12/12 homotype. These results suggest that patients with the Glu12/12 homotype exhibit elevated AC activity levels, which may help increase blood pressure to prevent syncope.

""" 39890919: Most of the fear literature on humans and animals tests healthy individuals. However, fear memories can differ between healthy individuals and those previously exposed to traumatic stress, such as a car accident, sexual abuse, military combat and personal assault. Traumatic stress can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which presents alterations in fear memories, such as an impairment of fear extinction and extinction recall. PTSD-like animal models are exposed to a single highly stressful experience in the laboratory, such as stress immobilization or single-prolonged stress. Some days later, animals exposed to a PTSD-like model can be tested in fear procedures that help uncover molecular mechanisms of fear memories. In this review, there are discussed the molecular mechanisms in stress-induced fear memories of patients with PTSD and PTSD-like animal models. The focus is on the effects of estradiol and cortisol/corticosterone hormones and of different genes, such as FKBP prolyl isomerase 5 gene (FKBP5) - FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) - pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1R), endocannabinoid (eCB) system and the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) - brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

""" 39684541: Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that alcohol use causes various abnormalities in the immune system and compromises immune functions. However, the mechanistic understanding of ethanol's effects on the immune system remains limited. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulates multiple processes, including immune responses. Earlier research indicated that type 7 adenylyl cyclase (AC7) regulates the immune system and is highly responsive to ethanol. Therefore, we hypothesized that AC7 is a central player in regulating the effects of alcohol on innate immune responses. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a myeloid lineage-specific AC7 KO mouse model and compared the effects of acute and chronic ethanol treatment on their innate immune responses induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Our results demonstrate that AC7 KO mice had significantly lower survival rates under LPS challenge. Chronic ethanol consumption rescued AC7 KO mice from LPS-induced death. AC7 KO and ethanol, acute and chronic, affected several measurements of cytokine mRNA expressions, including IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10 in the lung and liver. In a few cases, statistical analysis indicated that these two factors interacted, suggesting that AC7 played some role in ethanol's effect on cytokine expression. Thus, this study demonstrated AC7's role in ethanol's effect on the innate immune response. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39684541/ """,

Adult male ApoE-/- mice were fed a cholesterol-enriched diet (CED) or standard chow (SC) treated with Maxadilan, M65 or Sham. Effects of treatment on atherosclerotic plaques, lumen stenosis, apoptosis and pro-inflammatory signatures were analyzed in the brachiocephalic trunk (BT). The percentage of Maxadilan treated mice exhibiting plaques under SC and CED was lower than that of Sham or M65 treatment indicating opposite effects of Maxadilan and M65. Maxadilan application inhibited lumen stenosis in SC and CED mice compared to the Sham mice. In spite of increased cholesterol levels, lumen stenosis of Maxadilan-treated mice was similar under CED and SC. In contrast, M65 under SC or CED did not reveal a significant influence on lumen stenosis. Maxadilan significantly reduced the TNF-α-immunoreactive (TNF-α+) area in the plaques under CED, but not under SC. In contrast, the IL-1β+ area was reduced after Maxadilan treatment in SC mice but remained unchanged in CED mice compared to Sham mice. Maxadilan reduced caspase-3 immunoreactive (caspase-3+) in the tunica media under both, SC and CED without affecting lipid content in plaques.

""" 39582099: Glyoxylate is a toxic metabolite because of its rapid conversion into oxalate, as catalyzed by the ubiquitous enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This requires the presence of efficient glyoxylate detoxification systems in multiple subcellular compartments, as glyoxylate is produced in peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the cytosol. Alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) are the key enzymes involved in glyoxylate detoxification. Bi-allelic mutations in the genes coding for these enzymes cause primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and 2 (PH2), respectively. Glyoxylate is derived from various sources, including 4-hydroxyproline, which is degraded in mitochondria, generating pyruvate and glyoxylate, as catalyzed by the mitochondrial enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA); however, counterintuitively, a defect in HOGA1 is the molecular basis of primary hyperoxaluria type 3 (PH3). Irrespective of its underlying cause, hyperoxaluria in humans leads to nephrocalcinosis, recurrent urolithiasis, and kidney damage, which may culminate in kidney failure requiring combined liver-kidney transplantation in severely affected patients. In the past few years, therapeutic options, especially for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), have greatly been improved thanks to the introduction of two RNAi-based therapies that inhibit either the production of glycolate oxidase (lumasiran) or lactate dehydrogenase (nedosiran). While lumasiran only targets PH1 patients, nedosiran was specifically developed to target all three subtypes of PH. Inspired by the findings reported in the literature that nedosiran effectively reduced urinary oxalate excretion in PH1 patients but not in PH2 or PH3 patients, we have now revisited glyoxylate metabolism in humans and performed a thorough literature study which revealed that glyoxylate/oxalate metabolism is not confined to the liver but instead involves multiple different organs. This new view on glyoxylate/oxalate metabolism in humans may well explain the disappointing results of nedosiran in PH2 and PH3, and provides new clues for the future generation of new therapeutic strategies for PH2 and PH3. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39582099/ """,

""" 39856869: Lignification often occurs during low-temperature storage in loquat fruit, leading to increased firmness and lignin content, water loss, and changes in flavor. As induced stress factors, short-time high-oxygen pre-treatment (SHOP) can initiate resistant metabolism and regulate the physicochemical qualities during fresh fruit storage. However, the effect of SHOP on the lignification and quality of loquat has been reported less. In the present study, loquat fruit was immersed in oxygen concentrations of 70%, 80%, and 90% for 30 min before being stored at 4 ± 1 °C. The results showed that the 80% SHOP samples had lower lignin accumulation and firmness, showing reductions of 23.1% and 21.1% compared to the control at 50 days. These effects were associated with the inhibition of the activities of lignin synthesis-related enzymes, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), and peroxidase (POD). Meanwhile, 80% SHOP improved the antioxidant enzyme system and maintained the structural integrity of the cells.

Currently, there are only a few studies on the effects of salinity on P. graviera. Therefore, it is particularly important to study the molecular responses of P. gravieri to salinity fluctuations. In this study, P. gravieri was treated with salinities of 10, 25, and 40, and the hepatopancreas and gills of shrimp in the different salinity groups were sampled after 24 h. The samples were used for RNA extraction and transcriptome analysis. In total, 80,994 unigenes were obtained, of which 19,114 were annotated. The differences in gene expression between different tissues at the same salinity were more significant. Many metabolism-related genes were downregulated in the gills, such as beta-hexosaminidase subunit alpha (HEXA), 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1), and Alcohol dehydrogenase class-3 (ADH5). Scanning transmission electron microscope analysis showed that the expression levels of some stress-(but not salinity stress) related genes changed after stress (mostly upregulated), suggesting the existence of secondary stress. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focused on the expression of transporters in osmoregulation, and the results showed that they mainly played a role in the gills, but ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were more active in the hepatopancreas. This study showed that the response of P. gravieri to salinity change was different not only between the hepatopancreas and gills, but also between low salinity and higher salinity, and the ion transport-related genes were mainly expressed in the gills.

X-rays of the hand and knee joints were scored using a semi-quantitative grading system to calculate the total score of the hand and knee joints. ALDH2 rs671 genotyping was performed by high-resolution melting analysis. MR instrumental variable analysis and observational multivariable regression analysis were used to estimate the association between genetically predicted alcohol intake and the radiographic severity of OA. Subjects with the G/G genotype had a higher current alcohol intake than those with the G/A and A/A genotypes in both men and women (all P < 0.001). Men with the G/G genotype had higher total knee (P < 0.001) and hand scores (P = 0.042) compared to those with the G/A and A/A genotypes after adjusting for age and body mass index, but not in women.

Here we present a fully human nitric-oxide-responsive gene-regulation system for the on-demand and localized release of therapeutic proteins through clinically licensed nitroglycerin patches. Designed for simplicity and robust human compatibility, the system incorporates human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase for converting nitroglycerin into nitric oxide, which then activates soluble guanylate cyclase to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate, followed by protein kinase G to amplify the signal and to trigger target gene expression. In a proof-of-concept study, human cells expressing the nitroglycerin-responsive system were encapsulated and implanted subcutaneously in obese mice with type 2 diabetes. Transdermal nitroglycerin patches applied over the implant enabled the controlled and reversible production of glucagon-like peptide-1 throughout the 35-day experimental period, effectively restoring blood glucose levels in these mice without affecting heart rate or blood pressure.

""" 39001490: Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone in lung cancer treatment, yet emerging evidence suggests that sublethal low doses may inadvertently enhance the malignancy. This study investigates the paradoxical effects of sublethal low-dose chemotherapy on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, emphasizing the role of Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10). We found that sublethal doses of chemotherapy unexpectedly increased cancer cell migration approximately 2-fold and invasion approximately threefold, potentially promoting metastasis. Our analysis revealed a significant upregulation of AKR1B10 in response to taxol and doxorubicin treatment, correlating with poor survival rates in lung cancer patients. Furthermore, silencing AKR1B10 resulted in a 1-2-fold reduction in cell proliferation and a 2-3-fold reduction in colony formation and migration while increasing chemotherapy sensitivity. In contrast, the overexpression of AKR1B10 stimulated growth rate by approximately 2-fold via ERK pathway activation, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention. The reversal of these effects upon the application of an ERK-specific inhibitor further validates the significance of the ERK pathway in AKR1B10-mediated chemoresistance. In conclusion, our findings significantly contribute to the understanding of chemotherapy-induced adaptations in lung cancer cells. The elevated AKR1B10 expression following sublethal chemotherapy presents a novel molecular mechanism contributing to the development of chemoresistance. It highlights the need for strategic approaches in chemotherapy administration to circumvent the inadvertent enhancement of cancer aggressiveness.

""" 39859619: Aleurocanthus spiniferus not only damages plant leaves directly but also causes a sooty blotch due to the honeydew secreted by the nymphs and adults. This pest is widespread and seems to be spreading from low latitude to higher latitude areas where winters are typically colder, indicating an increase in its cold tolerance. Changes in temperature help insects to anticipate the arrival of winter, allowing them to take defensive measures in advance. This study examines the impacts of brief warm pulses on the low-temperature tolerance of A. spiniferus, and analyzes the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying its cold adaptation, utilizing seasonal differences in cold tolerance. Intermittent training at 25 °C significantly improved the survival rate of overwintering nymphs (third and fourth instar) at -7 °C. Analysis of seasonal differences in the supercooling point (SCP) and freezing point (FP) revealed that overwintering nymph had the highest cold tolerance in November. Seasonal variation in levels of cold-resistant substances were also observed, with moisture decreasing during overwintering, while fat and glycerol levels increased. Conversely, glucose, sorbitol, and trehalose levels rose significantly at the end of the overwintering period. The expression profile of cold-resistant genes indicated that the aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B1 in Aleurocanthus spiniferus (AspiAKR1B1) shows a significant decrease at the end of the overwintering period. Knocking down AspiAKR1B1 led to a marked reduction in the cold tolerance of A. spiniferus. Therefore, brief warm pulses and AspiAKR1B1 are key factors contributing to the enhanced cold tolerance of A. spiniferus.

Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1) has been identified to act as a protective factor in ferroptosis. However, whether AKR1C1 was involved in the development of ICH was unknown. In this study, the left cerebral striatum of the Sprague-Dawley rat was injected with collagenase type IV to induce an in vivo model. Primary rat cortical neurons treated with oxygen hemoglobin (OxyHb) were applied to as an in vitro model. AKR1C1 was found to be downregulated and immunoreactivity colocalized with NeuN-positive neurons in the perihematomal region. Rats injected with lentiviral particles overexpressing AKR1C1 showed the reduction of cerebral hematoma and the remission of blood-brain barrier disruption. Moreover, AKR1C1 upregulation repressed cell apoptosis and ferroptosis induced by ICH through downregulating the expression of pro-apoptotic factors, inhibiting iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, along with increasing the expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). The results of in vitro assays were consistent with results from the in vivo.

Methods: We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and unsupervised clustering analysis to investigate the roles of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) in glioma. DEG (differently expressed gene) screening and correlation analysis were conducted to filter the candidate genes which were closely associated with EMT process in SCG. Enrichment analysis and GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis) were conducted to investigate the potential mechanism of RDH10 for SCG. Trans-well and healing assay were performed to explore the role of RDH10 in the invasion of SCG. Western blotting was performed to evaluate the levels of markers in PI3K-AKT and EMT pathway. In vivo tests were conducted to verify the role of RDH10 in EMT process. Results: Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated the EMT pathway was associated with dismal prognosis of glioma. Further analysis demonstrated that RDH10 showed the strongest correlation with the EMT process. Retinol Dehydrogenase 10 expression was significantly increased in SCG tissues, correlating with advanced tumor grade and unfavorable prognosis. Functional analysis indicated that decreasing RDH10 levels impeded the invasive and migratory abilities of SCG cells, whereas increasing RDH10 levels augmented them. Enrichment analysis and western blot revealed that RDH10 regulated EMT process of SCG by PI3K-AKT pathway. We observed that the enhanced invasion ability and increased EMT-related protein induced by RDH10 overexpression can be suppressed by PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitor (LY294002).

Taken together, these findings suggest that increased ROS production in the NAc contributes to the neuropharmacological properties of nicotine. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39952992/ """,
