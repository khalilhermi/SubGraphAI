""" 38565302: The human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) have crucial roles in metabolizing and clearing numerous small lipophilic compounds. The UGT1A locus generates nine UGT1A mRNAs, 65 spliced transcripts, and 34 circular RNAs. In this study, our analysis of published UGT-RNA capture sequencing (CaptureSeq) datasets identified novel splice junctions that predict 24 variant UGT1A transcripts derived from ligation of exon 2 to unique sequences within the UGT1A first-exon region using cryptic donor splice sites. Of these variants, seven (1A1_n1, 1A3_n3, 1A4_n4, 1A5_n1, 1A8_n2, 1A9_n2, 1A10_n7) are predicted to encode UGT1A proteins with truncated aglycone-binding domains. We assessed their expression profiles and deregulation in cancer using four RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets of paired normal and cancerous drug-metabolizing tissues from large patient cohorts. Variants were generally coexpressed with their canonical counterparts with a higher relative abundance in tumor than in normal tissues. Variants showed tissue-specific expression with high interindividual variability but overall low abundance. However, 1A8_n2 showed high abundance in normal and cancerous colorectal tissues, with levels that approached or surpassed canonical 1A8 mRNA levels in many samples. We cloned 1A8_n2 and showed expression of the predicted protein (1A8_i3) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells. Glucuronidation assays with 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) showed that 1A8_i3 had no activity and was unable to inhibit the activity of 1A8_i1 protein. In summary, the activation of cryptic donor splice sites within the UGT1A first-exon region expands the UGT1A transcriptome and proteome. The 1A8_n2 cryptic donor splice site is highly active in colorectal tissues, representing an important cis-regulatory element that negatively regulates the function of the UGT1A8 gene through pre-mRNA splicing. SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT: The UGT1A locus generates nine canonical mRNAs, 65 alternately spliced transcripts, and 34 different circular RNAs. The present study reports a series of novel UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A variants resulting from use of cryptic donor splice sites in both normal and cancerous tissues, several of which are predicted to encode variant UGT1A proteins with truncated aglycone-binding domains. Of these, 1A8_n2 shows exceptionally high abundance in colorectal tissues, highlighting its potential role in the first-pass metabolism in gut through the glucuronidation pathway. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38565302/ """,

""" 39722440: UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are responsible for inactivation of a variety of drugs, endogenous hormones and environmental toxicants. Chemical inhibitors are a common factor decreasing UGT activities and furtherly inducing health problems. Although simultaneously encountering different inhibitors is readily to occur, no information is available for combined inhibition of UGT. This in vitro study investigates the combined inhibition of human UGT1A9 by endogenous and foodborne inhibitors (magnolol, di-bromophenols, UDP). J values (the ratio of inhibitory rate to the remaining activity) are analysed to determine the combined inhibition type. The combined inhibition of di-bromophenols and UDP obeys additive inhibition, in which combined J values equal to the sum of individual J values in alone inhibition assays. Meanwhile, there is a synergistic effect between 2,4-di-bromophenol and magnolol with combination index values ranging from 0.10 to 0.85. Further assays indicate that 2,4-di-bromophenol decreases IC<sub>50</sub> values for magnolol and vice versa. Kinetic analysis confirms that the two inhibitors and UGT1A9 can form a ternary complex with the inhibition constants of 0.0188 μM (magnolol) and 0.634 (2,4-di-bromophenol) μM. In summary, this study demonstrates that besides additive inhibition, synergistic inhibition is a probable occurrence in combined inhibition of UGT. It is suggested that the inhibitors can increase mutual inhibitory effects which deserves attentions in future UGT inhibition related studies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39722440/ """,

Additionally, liver microsomal and cytosolic fractions from rat, mouse and pig were used. Following incubations of the biocolourants with the enzymes in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, UDP-glucuronic acid, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) or S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to enable CYP oxidation, glucuronidation, sulfonation or methylation, we observed several oxidation and conjugation metabolites for dermocybin but none for dermorubin. Human CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 and 3A7 catalysed dermocybin oxidation. The formation of dermocybin glucuronides was catalysed by human UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10 and 2B15. Human SULT1B1, 1C2 and 2A1 sulfonated dermocybin. Dermocybin oxidation was faster than conjugation in human liver microsomes. Species differences were seen in dermocybin glucuronidation between human, rat, mouse and pig.

Although pharmacogenomics assesses genotypic differences, it does not report changes in metabolic enzyme activities due to environmental factors such as drug interactions. Here, we report a quantitative proteomics strategy to monitor drug metabolic pathways by profiling metabolic enzymes in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) upon drug exposure. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based measurement revealed that changes in metabolic enzyme abundance in EVs paralleled those in hepatic cells isolated from liver tissue. Coupling with multiplexed isotopic labeling, we temporally quantified 34 proteins involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) pathways. Out of 44 known ADME proteins in plasma EVs, previously annotated mouse cytochrome P450 3A11 (Cyp3a11), homolog to human CYP3A4, and uridine 5'-diphospho (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase 2A3 (Ugt2a3), increased upon daily rifampicin dosage. Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat leukemia, also elevated Cyp3a11 levels in plasma EVs, but to a lesser extent. Altogether, this study demonstrates that measuring drug enzymes in circulating EVs as an effective surrogate is highly feasible and may transform today's drug discovery and development for personalized medicine. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38312223/ """,

""" 39771577: Background: Morphine is a commonly prescribed opioid analgesic used to treat chronic pain. Morphine undergoes glucuronidation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 to form morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine is the gold standard for chronic pain management and has a narrow therapeutic index. Reports have shown that chronic pain patients have increasingly used other supplements to treat their chronic pain, including cannabidiol (CBD). Up to 50% of chronic pain patients report that they co-use cannabis with their prescribed opioid for pain management, including morphine. Previous work has shown that cannabidiol is a potent inhibitor of UGT2B7, including morphine-mediated metabolism. Co-use of morphine and CBD may result in unwanted drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Methods: Using available physiochemical and clinical parameters, morphine and CBD physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were developed and validated in both healthy and cirrhotic populations. Models for the two populations were then combined to predict the severity and clinical relevance of the potential DDIs during coadministration of both morphine and CBD in both healthy and hepatic-impaired virtual populations. Results: The predictive DDI model suggests that a ~5% increase in morphine exposure is to be expected in healthy populations. A similar increase in exposure of morphine is predicted in severe hepatic-impaired populations with an increase of ~10. Conclusions: While these predicted increases in morphine exposure are below the Food and Drug Administration's cutoff (1.25-fold increase), morphine has a narrow therapeutic index and a 5-10% increase in exposure may be clinically relevant. Future clinical studies are needed to fully characterize the clinical relevance of morphine-related DDIs. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39771577/ """,
""" 39709740: Nucleoside mono-, di- and triphosphates (NMP, NDP, and NTP) and their deoxy-counterparts (dNMP, dNDP, dNTP) are involved in energy metabolism and are the building blocks of RNA and DNA, respectively. The production of NTP and dNTP is carried out by several NMP kinases (NMPK) and NDP kinases (NDPK). All NMPKs are fully reversible and use defined Mg-free and Mg-complexed nucleotides in both directions of their reactions, with Mg2+ controlling the ratios of Mg-free and Mg-complexed reactants. Their activities are driven by adenylates produced by adenylate kinase which controls the direction of NMPK and NDPK reactions, depending on the energy status of a cell. This enzymatic machinery is localized in the cytosol, mitochondria, and plastids, i.e. compartments with high energy budgets and where (except for cytosol) RNA and DNA synthesis occur. Apparent equilibrium constants of NMPKs, based on total nucleotide contents, are [Mg2+]-dependent. This allows for an indirect estimation of internal [Mg2+], which constitutes a signal of the energetic status of a given tissue/cell/compartment. Adenylates contribute the most to this Mg2+-signal, followed by uridylates, guanylates, and cytidylates, with deoxynucleotides' contribution deemed negligible. A method to quantify the Mg2+-signal, using nucleotide datasets, is discussed. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39709740/ """,

ASD prevalence in Lebanon is 1 in 68 with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. This study aims to investigate the impact of an inherited deletion in UBLCP1 (Ubiquitin-Like Domain-Containing CTD Phosphatase 1) on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and proteolysis. Whole exome sequencing in a Lebanese family with ASD without pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) uncovered a deletion in UBLCP1. Functional evaluation of the identified variant is described in fibroblasts from the affected. The deletion in UBLCP1 exon 10 (g.158,710,261CAAAG > C) generates a premature stop codon interrupting the phosphatase domain and is predicted as pathogenic. It is absent from databases of normal variation worldwide and in Lebanon. Wild-type UBLCP1 is widely expressed in mouse brains. The mutation results in decreased UBLCP1 protein expression in patient-derived fibroblasts from the autistic patient compared to controls. The truncated UBLCP1 protein results in increased proteasome activity decreased ubiquitinated protein levels, and downregulation in expression of other proteasome subunits in samples from the affected compared to controls. Inhibition of the proteasome by using MG132 in proband cells reverses alterations in gene expression due to the restoration of protein levels of the common transcription factor, NRF1. Finally, treatment with gentamicin, which promotes premature termination codon read-through, restores UBLCP1 expression and function. Discovery of an ASD-linked mutation in UBLCP1 leading to overactivation of cell proteolysis is reported. This, in turn, leads to dysregulation of proteasome subunit transcript levels as a compensatory response. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38129378/ """,

Evidence suggests that Cyc/CDK targets extend beyond traditional proteins and include enzymes that regulate the central carbon metabolism. Maize embryo axes rapidly internalize and metabolize glucose. After 24 h of imbibition in glucose-rich media, axes exhibited increased length and weight, with more pronounced effects at 72 h. This morphology enhancement was impaired when RO-3306, a specific CDK inhibitor, was added. The protein profile of maize embryo extracts at 18 and 24 h indicated altered phosphorylation patterns following CDK activity inhibition. Metabolomic analysis at 24 h of imbibition revealed that maize embryos without sugar in the media, with or without RO-3306, had a decreased sugar and amino acid content. Conversely, axes exposed to glucose demonstrated increased conversion into various mono and di-saccharides such as fructose, mannitol, galactose, and maltose but not sucrose. This pattern was reversed upon the addition of RO-3306. Glucose promoted the accumulation of amino acids such as cysteine, valine, leucine, and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, such as malate and citrate. The CDK inhibitor redirected the glucose metabolism toward increased serine levels, followed by other amino acids like phenylalanine, valine, and leucine. Additionally, TCA cycle intermediates and sterols significantly decreased.

Double screening of miRNAs in CRC cell-exosomes and serum-exosomes from clinical CRC patients revealed that miR-224-5p was expressed at significantly lower levels in the 5-FU resistant type than in the 5-FU sensitive type. Moreover, the overall survival rates of 5-FU-resistant CRC patients were much lower than those of 5-FU-sensitive CRC patients.

Overall, miR-224-5p is involved in CRC 5-FU resistance by regulating S100A4, and might serve as a molecular marker for the early prediction and intervention of 5-FU resistance in CRC patients in the clinic.

""" 39955083: Managing West syndrome (WS) becomes arduous in regions where access to adrenocorticotropic hormone and vigabatrin is limited, particularly in developing nations. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of very high-dose oral prednisolone in children diagnosed with WS. Children aged 2-36 months presenting with WS were consecutively enrolled and given oral prednisolone @ 8 mg/kg/day (maximum 40 mg) for two weeks followed by tapering doses over the subsequent two weeks. Weekly follow-ups were conducted until therapy completion, followed by bi-weekly assessments for three months. Responses (primary outcome) were assessed at two weeks and categorized as complete (spasm-free), partial (>25% reduction), or no response (<25% reduction). Neurodevelopmental outcomes, clinical-radiological profiles, safety, and therapy response predictors were also assessed. Of the 80 children, 73.7% exhibited a complete response, while 21.2% and 5% showed partial and no response, respectively. The mean age at spasm onset and presentation was 4.98 ± 4.37 months and 14.36 ± 7.13 months, respectively. Perinatal brain injury accounted for 87.5% of WS cases. Adverse effects, including weight gain (8.7%), irritability, hypertension, and disturbed sleep (3.7% each), were noted. Spasm cessation at 2 weeks, appropriate gestational age, and the absence of other seizure types were predictive of a favorable response. High-dose oral prednisolone emerges as an effective, low-cost, and safer first-line treatment option with minimal adverse effects in the Uttar Pradesh region in India, and this would likely be true in other resource-limited settings. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955083/ """,
""" 39940236: Background: Total hip replacement (THR) significantly improves patients' quality of life; however, prosthesis loosening remains a significant complication. Vitamin D, essential for calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization, is transported and stabilized by vitamin D binding protein (VDBP). Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDBP gene, rs4588 and rs7041, may influence serum vitamin D levels and potentially impact THR outcomes. This study aimed to analyze the association between these SNPs, serum levels of VDBP and 25(OH)D, and their potential roles in THR outcomes. Methods: The study included three patient groups: (1) patients undergoing arthroscopy after a THR without prosthesis loosening (CA-Control Arthroplasty), (2) patients with hip prosthesis loosening (L-Loosening), and (3) a control group (C-Control). Genotyping of rs4588 and rs7041 in the VDBP gene was conducted using PCR-RFLP and TaqMan Genotyping real-time PCR. Serum levels of VDBP and 25(OH)D were measured using ELISA. Comparisons between groups were performed using statistical analyses, including odds ratios (OR) and significance testing (p-values). Results: There are significant differences in VDBP concentrations between the groups: L vs. CA (p &lt; 0.0001), L vs. C (p = 0.0118), L vs. L + CA (p = 0.0013), CA vs. C (p &lt; 0.0001), and CA vs. L + CA (p &lt; 0.0001), and in 25(OH)D concentrations between groups: L vs. C (p &lt; 0.0001), CA vs. C (p = 0.0008), and C vs. L + CA (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: The study findings suggest a protective role of 25(OH)D against prosthesis loosening in THR. The rs4588 SNP in the VDBP gene may increase the risk of loosening, while differences in VDBP and 25(OH)D concentrations between patient groups highlight their potential importance in THR outcomes. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39940236/ """,
""" 39661331: We present here a comprehensive update on recent advancements in the field of ferroptosis, with a particular emphasis on its metabolic underpinnings and physiological impacts. After briefly introducing landmark studies that have helped to shape the concept of ferroptosis as a distinct form of cell death, we critically evaluate the key metabolic determinants involved in its regulation. These include the metabolism of essential trace elements such as selenium and iron; amino acids such as cyst(e)ine, methionine, glutamine/glutamate, and tryptophan; and carbohydrates, covering glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and the pentose phosphate pathway. We also delve into the mevalonate pathway and subsequent cholesterol biosynthesis, including intermediate metabolites like dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, squalene, coenzyme Q (CoQ), vitamin K, and 7-dehydrocholesterol, as well as fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, including the biosynthesis and remodeling of ester and ether phospholipids and lipid peroxidation. Next, we highlight major ferroptosis surveillance systems, specifically the cyst(e)ine/glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4 axis, the NAD(P)H/ferroptosis suppressor protein 1/CoQ/vitamin K system, and the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1/tetrahydrobiopterin/dihydrofolate reductase axis. We also discuss other potential anti- and proferroptotic systems, including glutathione S-transferase P1, peroxiredoxin 6, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 like 1, nitric oxide, and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4. Finally, we explore ferroptosis's physiological roles in aging, tumor suppression, and infection control, its pathological implications in tissue ischemia-reperfusion injury and neurodegeneration, and its potential therapeutic applications in cancer treatment. Existing drugs and compounds that may regulate ferroptosis in vivo are enumerated. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39661331/ """,
""" 37171959: Vitamin K is a micronutrient necessary for γ-carboxylation of glutamic acids. This post-translational modification occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and affects secreted proteins. Recent clinical studies implicate vitamin K in the pathophysiology of diabetes, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse β cells lacking γ-carboxylation fail to adapt their insulin secretion in the context of age-related insulin resistance or diet-induced β cell stress. In human islets, γ-carboxylase expression positively correlates with improved insulin secretion in response to glucose. We identify endoplasmic reticulum Gla protein (ERGP) as a γ-carboxylated ER-resident Ca2+-binding protein expressed in β cells. Mechanistically, γ-carboxylation of ERGP protects cells against Ca2+ overfilling by diminishing STIM1 and Orai1 interaction and restraining store-operated Ca2+ entry. These results reveal a critical role of vitamin K-dependent carboxylation in regulation of Ca2+ flux in β cells and in their capacity to adapt to metabolic stress. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37171959/ """,
""" 39051417: Background: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions have been the mainstay of hemostatic intervention for the treatment of bleeding and coagulation abnormalities arising during liver transplantation (LT) for decades. However, numerous clinical studies showed that FFP has many side effects, including the risk of pathogen transmission, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM), and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). These adverse events are particularly challenging in patients undergoing LT, who often suffer from severe portal hypertension, poor renal function and coexisting cardiac disease.The aims of this review are to summarize the pharmacological properties of currently available PCCs, to represent the theoretical benefits and the possible risks related to the use of these drugs in patients undergoing LT, and, finally, to review the current literature on the topic in order to highlight the evidence that currently supports PCC use in LT patients. Methods: The current literature on the topic was reviewed in order to highlight the evidence that currently supports PCC use in LT patients. Results: Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) may offer several advantages when compared to FFP. Indeed, PCCs have been shown to reduce the risk of TACO, which during liver transplantation may deteriorate portal hypertension, increase intraoperative bleeding, and possibly reduce survival rates. One of the major concerns for PCC use is thrombogenicity. However, currently available PCCs are much safer as they contain inactivated forms of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors and protein C, protein S, antithrombin and/or heparin. Nowadays, the use of PCCs to correct coagulation abnormalities that occur during LT is an increasingly widespread practice. However, it is not yet clear what level of evidence supports this practice, and what the risks associated with it are. Conclusions: Administration of PCC in LT patients to correct haemostatic abnormalities seems to be well-tolerated, but the relationship between PCC use and thromboembolic events in the postoperative period remains unclear. Adequately powered, methodologically sound trials are urgently required for more definitive conclusions about the efficacy and safety of PCCs in a broad phenotype of LT recipients. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39051417/ """,

""" 39711234: Zaltoprofen (ZAL) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a short half-life (∼2.8 h) due to extensive first pass metabolism. In this context, 16 different polymeric film forming solutions (PFFS) of ZAL were developed using different grades of Eudragits, Polyvinylpyrrolidones, Kollicoat MAE 100 P and Hydroxypropyl cellulose as film formers, and polyethylene glycol 400 as a plasticizer in equal parts of ethanol and isopropyl alcohol used as solvents. Of these solutions, F13 composed of Kollicoat MAE 100 P emerged as an optimal PFFS as it quickly formed a saturated film (10.25 ± 0.75 min) that displayed low drying time (3.00 ± 0.46 min), and high in vitro adhesion (2.67 ± 0.58). Ex vivo permeation studies conducted in Franz diffusion cell across porcine skin indicated that F13 displayed significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) steady state flux (8.64 ± 1.72 µg.cm-2.h-1), shorter lag time (∼3 h) and better skin content (2.55 ± 0.62 µg/mg) compared to other PFFS. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) proved the chemical integrity of ZAL in polymeric film formed from F13, while Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray Diffractometry (XRD) proved the anti-recrystallization potential of PFFS. Anti-inflammatory studies in rats indicated that F13 significantly inhibited (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001) carrageenan induced paw edema for nearly 12 h compared to topical diclofenac used as standard. In addition, significantly elevated (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001) analgesic effect was noted in the hot plate test in rats treated with F13 compared to the standard for 12 h proving the superior efficacy of F13.

""" 39817632: 3-Fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides are invaluable probes for studying the catalytic mechanism of sialidases (neuraminidases), and as sialidase inhibitors. Significantly, when a C-3 equatorial fluorine is installed on a C-4 functionalised N-acylneuraminic acid (Neu)-based template, the compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of both influenza and parainfluenza sialidases, and of virus replication. Typically, the reported syntheses of 3-fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides involve either an enzymatic or a chemical synthesis that have uncontrolled stereoselectivity in the introduction of fluorine at C-3 of Neu and consequently yield a mixture of C-3 ax and C-3 eq fluoro derivatives. We now report a simple approach for the exquisitely stereo-controlled introduction of the C-3 equatorial fluorine on Neu by incorporation of steric bulk at C-4.

They catalyze the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> to bicarbonate and protons and are involved in pH regulation, chemosensing, and metabolism. The 15 α-CA isoforms present in humans are pharmacological drug targets known for decades, their inhibitors being used as diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, or antiobesity drugs, as well as for the management of acute mountain sickness, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and recently, as antitumor theragnostic agents. Other potential applications include the use of CA inhibitors (CAIs) in inflammatory conditions, cerebral ischemia, neuropathic pain, or Alzheimer/Parkinson disease management. CAs from pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and nematodes have started to be considered as drug targets in recent years, with notable advances being registered. CAIs have a complex multipharmacology probably unique to this enzyme, which has been exploited intensely but may lead to other relevant applications in the future due to the emergence of drug design approaches that afforded highly isoform-selective compounds for most α-CAs known to date. They belong to a multitude of chemical classes (sulfonamides and isosteres, [iso]coumarins and related compounds, mono- and dithiocarbamates, selenols, ninhydrines, boronic acids, benzoxaboroles, etc). The polypharmacology of CAIs will also be discussed because drugs originally discovered for the treatment of non-CA related conditions (topiramate, zonisamide, celecoxib, pazopanib, thiazide, and high-ceiling diuretics) show effective inhibition against many CAs, which led to their repurposing for diverse pharmacological applications. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CAIs have multiple pharmacologic applications, such as diuretics, antiglaucoma, antiepileptic, antiobesity, antiacute mountain sickness, anti-idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and antitumor drugs. Their use in inflammatory conditions, cerebral ischemia, neuropathic pain, or neurodegenerations has started to be investigated recently. Parasite carbonic anhydrases are also drug targets for anti-infectives with novel mechanisms of action that can bypass drug resistance to commonly used agents.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that NO regulates expression of PDE3A, a cGMP-inhibited PDE. Incubation of rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (rPaSMCs) with the NO-donor compound S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO) increased PDE3A gene expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. NO-donors increased PDE3A protein levels. Total and milrinone inhibitable cAMP PDE activity were increased 2.8 ± 0.1- and 2.0 ± 0.1-fold respectively in extracts of rPaSMCs exposed to GSNO. The effects of GSNO on PDE3A gene expression were mimicked by the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activators YC-1 and BAY 41-2272 and blocked by the sGC inhibitor ODQ. Incubation of rPaSMC with interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α induced PDE3A gene expression, an effect which was inhibited by L-NIL, an antagonist of NO synthase 2, or ODQ. Actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase, blocked the GSNO-induced increase of PDE3A mRNA levels, whereas cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein translation, did not. These observations suggest that NO modulates PDE3A gene expression via mechanisms dependent upon cGMP synthesis and gene transcription.
