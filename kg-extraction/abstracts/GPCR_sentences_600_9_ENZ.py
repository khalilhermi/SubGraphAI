""" 38929118: Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors widely used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway leads to the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway has been suggested to not only facilitate inflammatory responses and the production of type I interferons (IFN), but also activate other cellular processes, such as apoptosis. It has not been studied, however, whether cGAS-STING activation is involved in the apoptosis induced by statin treatment in human colorectal cancer cells. In this study, we reported that lovastatin impaired mitochondrial function, including the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduction of oxygen consumption, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity, and mtDNA abundance in human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. The mitochondrial dysfunction markedly induced ROS production in mitochondria, whereas the defect in mitochondria respiration or depletion of mitochondria eliminated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage by lovastatin treatment was attenuated by mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (mitoQ). Upon DNA damage, mtDNA was released into the cytosol and bound to DNA sensor cGAS, thus activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to trigger a type I interferon response. This effect was not activated by nuclear DNA (nuDNA) or mitochondrial RNA, as the depletion of mitochondria compromised this effect, but not the knockdown of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1/melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (RIG-I/MDA5) adaptor or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Moreover, lovastatin-induced apoptosis was partly dependent on the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in HCT116 cells as the knockdown of cGAS or STING expression rescued cell viability and mitigated apoptosis. Similarly, the knockdown of cGAS or STING also attenuated the antitumor effect of lovastatin in the HCT116 xenograft model in vivo. Our findings suggest that lovastatin-induced apoptosis is at least partly mediated through the cGAS-STING signaling pathway by triggering mtDNA accumulation in the cytosol in human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38929118/ """,
""" 38267705: Sterile inflammation, also known as 'inflammaging', is a hallmark of tissue aging. Cellular senescence contributes to tissue aging, in part, through the secretion of proinflammatory factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The genetic variability of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) is associated with aging and age-associated phenotypes such as late-life survival, activity of daily living and physical performance in old age. TXNRD1's role in regulating tissue aging has been attributed to its enzymatic role in cellular redox regulation. Here, we show that TXNRD1 drives the SASP and inflammaging through the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) innate immune response pathway independently of its enzymatic activity. TXNRD1 localizes to cytoplasmic chromatin fragments and interacts with cGAS in a senescence-status-dependent manner, which is necessary for the SASP. TXNRD1 enhances the enzymatic activity of cGAS. TXNRD1 is required for both the tumor-promoting and immune surveillance functions of senescent cells, which are mediated by the SASP in vivo in mouse models. Treatment of aged mice with a TXNRD1 inhibitor that disrupts its interaction with cGAS, but not with an inhibitor of its enzymatic activity alone, downregulated markers of inflammaging in several tissues. In summary, our results show that TXNRD1 promotes the SASP through the innate immune response, with implications for inflammaging. This suggests that the TXNRD1-cGAS interaction is a relevant target for selectively suppressing inflammaging. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38267705/ """,
""" 39937238: Neuropathic pain is a complex and challenging condition that arises from abnormal processing of somatosensory information, often following nerve injury or dysfunction. Its diagnosis involves a detailed clinical history, sensory examination, and diagnostic tests such as electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and MRI to identify nerve damage or structural causes. In athletes, neuropathic pain can result from nerve entrapment syndromes, post-surgical complications, or peripheral nerve injuries, with unique challenges in pain assessment due to psychological factors and exercise-induced changes. Pharmacological management primarily includes anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin) and antidepressants (e.g., tricyclics, SNRIs), tailored to minimize side effects that could impair athletic performance. Effective treatment requires a careful balance to manage pain while maintaining physical capabilities. When treating athletes for neuropathic pain, healthcare providers must ensure prescribed medications comply with World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) regulations. Narcotics (opioids) and cannabinoids are prohibited in-competition. Glucocorticoids are also banned in-competition if administered via injection, orally, or rectally, and elevated levels in urine may lead to sanctions. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937238/ """,

In this study, we report the discovery of ionic arginine-rich peptides to disrupt the pathogenic galectin-10 (gal-10) crystallization, where the aberrant deposition of gal-10 crystals in airways causes the activation of IL-1β-dependent inflammation and the stimulation of epithelial cells to produce TNF-α. Gal-10 crystals show susceptibility to pH changes and charged residue substitutions at the protein packing interfaces, manifesting the role of charge-charge attractions across protein-protein interaction interfaces in governing gal-10 crystallization. To dissolve the gal-10 crystal, the ionic peptides R9 and R12Y8 were identified to eliminate the interprotein charge-charge interactions. The efficacy of R12Y8 in mitigating the gal-10 crystallopathy in vivo was assessed in a crystal-induced lung inflammation mice model. The mice intratracheally administrated by R12Y8 exhibited a downregulated release of proinflammatory cytokines and reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs.

The effect of THC on murine and human brain microvascular endothelial cells revealed that THC-induced BBB damage was partly mediated by CB1R activation, triggering the oxidative stress response. This study provides new theoretical insights into the mechanisms of THC-induced BBB damage and offers novel scientific evidence for the potential neurotoxicity and adverse reactions induced by THC. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956317/ """,
""" 39952992: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in behaviors induced by acute or repeated cocaine or methamphetamine administration in rodents. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of ROS in behavioral changes induced by nicotine administration and dopamine (DA) transmission changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats. Rats were given repeated saline or nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) administration once daily for seven days, and the induction of hyperlocomotor activity, and oxidative stress marker expression induced by the increase in ROS production in the NAc were measured on day 7. We also tested the effect of ROS scavengers on repeated nicotine-induced hyperlocomotor activity and nicotine self-administration, and DA levels in the NAc. Repeated nicotine administration induced hyperlocomotor activity and decreased the expression of oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 1/2, by elevating ROS production in the NAc. Pretreatment with the nonspecific ROS scavenger PBN and the superoxide-selective scavenger TEMPOL significantly attenuated nicotine-induced hyperlocomotor activity without impairing motor function in nicotine-naïve rats on day 7. In addition, in intravenous nicotine self-administration study, TEMPOL significantly reduced nicotine-taking behavior without affecting food intake in nicotine-naïve rats. Furthermore, TEMPOL pretreatment prevented nicotine effects on stimulated DA release in the NAc, which was associated with nicotine-induced behavioral changes. Taken together, these findings suggest that increased ROS production in the NAc contributes to the neuropharmacological properties of nicotine. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39952992/ """,
""" 39956261: Lithospermic acid (LA), a plant-derived polycyclic phenolic carboxylic acid, is known for its strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, its effects have not yet been studied in ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to assess the protective effects of LA in UC and investigate its potential mechanisms of action. Our findings indicated that LA effectively mitigated oxidative stress in mice with colitis by increasing the production of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), while reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (p<0.05 for all). In NCM460 cells, LA inhibited the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in ROS and preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that LA decreased the production of inflammatory markers (p<0.05). Additionally, LA upregulated intestinal mucosal proteins, contributing to mucosal barrier repair. Mechanistically, LA activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling pathway, increasing the expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) while inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation (p<0.05). Notably, the inhibition of Nrf2 reversed the protective effects of LA against colitis. Molecular docking analyses support a strong interaction between Nrf2 and LA. LA mitigates colitis-related inflammation and oxidative stress mainly by activating the Nrf2 signalling pathway. These findings support the potential development of LA as a novel therapeutic agent for UC. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956261/ """,

However, the mechanism by which Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) negatively affects the central nervous system, especially the blood-brain barrier (BBB), remains unclear. THC exposure models were established in vivo and in vitro. The BBB properties were examined using Western blotting (WB), immunofluorescence staining (IF), transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), and flux of sodium fluorescein (SF). The oxidative stress regulators were examined using IF and assay kits. The activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) was examined using WB and IF. The THC exposure caused barrier integrity damage and endothelial dysfunction in murine and hCMEC/D<sub>3</sub> cells, conclude albumin leakage, increased SF permeability and reduced TEER value. The expression of tight junction proteins, including claudin 5, occludin, and junctional adhesion molecules, was decreased. Additionally, key oxidative stress regulators, including reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, malonaldehyde levels, and antioxidant enzyme activities, including catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase, and heme oxygenase 1, were increased.

""" 39954860: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are frequently utilized to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several GLP-1RAs (Exendin-4 and liraglutide) have been shown to accelerate diabetic wound healing. The major aim of the study was to investigate the roles of dulaglutide in wound healing in diabetic mice and identify the underlying mechanism involved. Round-shape, full-thickness wounds were created on the backs of db/db diabetic mice. Subsequently, dulaglutide was delivered via subcutaneous injections surrounding the wound's perimeter, and the wound closure rates were monitored. In vitro, keratinocytes were treated with dulaglutide under high glucose (HG) conditions, and cell viability was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and EdU assays. The roles of dulaglutide in ferroptosis were assessed by measuring the levels of Fe2+ and oxidative stress, as well as the expression of ferroptosis markers. The results demonstrated that dulaglutide treatment increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the proliferation marker Ki67, thereby accelerating wound healing in diabetic mice. In vitro, dulaglutide promoted HaCaT cell proliferation and migration under HG conditions. Exposure of HaCaT cells to HG resulted in ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro, as evidenced by the significant increase in Fe2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the decrease in glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. All these effects were reversed by dulaglutide. Mechanistically, dulaglutide activated NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling under HG conditions, which increased glutathione peroxidase (Gpx4) and solute carrier family 7-member 11 (Slc7a11) expression, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis. In summary, these results demonstrate dulaglutide as a promising agent for treating diabetic wounds by regulating Nrf2-dependent ferroptosis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954860/ """,
""" 39851086: Effective delivery and controlled release of metallo-prodrugs with sustained activation and rapid response feed the needs of precise medicine in metal chemotherapeutics. However, gold-based anticancer drugs often suffer from detoxification binding and extracellular transfer by sulfur-containing peptides. To address this challenge, we integrate a thiol-activated prodrug strategy of newly prepared hypercoordinated carbon-centered gold(I) clusters (HCGCs) with their photosensitization character to augment the mitochondrial release of Au(I) in tumors. In contrast to the distorted [CAu<sub>4</sub>] kernel of a pentanuclear HCGC compound [A5], its dimeric congener [A9] exhibits a symmetrical [{CAu<sub>4</sub>}-Au-{CAu<sub>4</sub>}] structure with a remarkable hypercarbon-to-Au<sub>4</sub> electron donation. This unique arrangement results in a microsecond long metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited state relative to the nanosecond intraligand excited state of [A5]. Upon light irradiation at 560 nm, [A9] generates active 1O<sub>2</sub> to oxidize glutathione (GSH) into poorly coordinating GSSG in the cytoplasm and finally promotes subcellular delivery of HCGCs to mitochondria. Moreover, GSH further triggers consecutive release of active [AuPPh<sub>3</sub>]+ ions to inhibit cytoplasmic glutathione peroxidase GPX4 and mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase TrxR2, which collectively result in accelerated ferroptosis of human bladder cancer EJ cells and show excellent antitumor performance in mouse bladder tumor models. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39851086/ """,
""" 39956210: Although a number of microtubule-targeting agents have been used in tumour therapy, their resistance and drug toxicity pose clinical challenges. Microtubule destabilizing agents (MDAs) targeting the colchicine site were found to have the advantage of being able to overcome drug resistance. In our previous studies, we identified a novel MDA from the compound database based on virtual screening methods. Its chemical formula is C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>19</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S, abbreviated as C10. In this study, molecular docking methods confirmed that the binding pattern of C10 to tubulin is similar to that of colchicine. Immunofluorescence staining and tubulin polymerization experiments showed that C10 disrupts the microtubule network and reduces the polymerization efficiency of tubulin. Cell proliferation and toxicity assay showed that C10 could effectively inhibit the growth of tumour cells. After 72 h treatment, the semi-inhibitory concentrations of A549, MCF-7 and HepG2 were 18.83 μM, 16.32 μM and 16.92 μM. Colony formation assay and EdU staining also showed that C10 significantly inhibited the proliferative capacity of tumour cells. Meanwhile, it was found by wound healing and transwell assay that the migration and invasive ability of tumour cells were relatively weakened after treatment with C10. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis and western blot revealed that C10 reduced the expression of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and upregulated the level of the Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), which in turn activated caspase-3 to promote apoptosis. Finally, the vivo studies in animal showed that C10 significantly inhibited the growth of tumour in nude mice without significant drug toxicity. Thus, C10 may be a colchicine binding site inhibitor with anticancer potential.

""" 23161088: Glycerophosphocholine choline phosphodiesterase (GPC-Cpde) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored alkaline hydrolase that is expressed in the brain and kidney. In brain the hydrolase is synthesized by the oligodendrocytes and expressed on the myelin membrane. There are two forms of brain GPC-Cpde, a membrane-linked (mGPC-Cpde) and a soluble (sGPC-Cpde). Here we report the characterisation sGPC-Cpde from bovine brain. The amino acid sequence was identical to ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 6 (eNPP6) precursor, lacking the N-terminal signal peptide region and a C-terminal stretch, suggesting that the hydrolase was solubilised by C-terminal proteolysis, releasing the GPI-anchor. sGPC-Cpde existed as two isoforms, a homodimer joined by a disulfide bridge linking C414 from each monomer, and a monomer resulting from proteolysis N-terminally to this disulfide bond. The only internal disulfide bridge, linking C142 and C154, stabilises the choline-binding pocket. sGPC-Cpde was specific for lysosphingomyelin, displaying 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher catalytic activity than towards GPC and lysophosphatidylcholine, suggesting that GPC-Cpde may function in the sphingomyelin signaling, rather than in the homeostasis of acylglycerophosphocholine metabolites. The truncated high mannose and bisected hybrid type glycans linked to N118 and N341 of sGPC-Cpde is a hallmark of glycans in lysosomal glycoproteins, subjected to GlcNAc-1-phosphorylation en route through Golgi. Thus, sGPC-Cpde may originate from the lysosomes, suggesting that lysosomal sorting contributes to the level of mGPC-Cpde on the myelin membrane. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23161088/ """,
""" 39937973: Age-related diseases are becoming more prominent as the lifespan of the global population rises. Many of these diseases coincide with each other and can even influence the onset of additional comorbidities. Sarcopenic obesity is described as age-related loss of muscle mass that concurs with excessive weight gain and tends to increase the risk of comorbidity development, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though the exact link between sarcopenic obesity and AD is not known, this review explores the possibility that reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) throughout the body may serve as the underlying commonality. In AD, reductions in BDNF signalling through its receptor promote the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), which subsequently increases the production of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In the skeletal muscle, lower BDNF concentrations are linked to impaired muscle fibre repair and regeneration, increasing the likelihood of sarcopenia. Furthermore, the absence of BDNF impairs mitochondrial function, leading to insulin resistance and increased adiposity. BDNF concentration has a negative relationship with obesogenic markers in adipose tissue, and as such, lower concentrations of BDNF lead to weight gain. Collectively, current literature suggests that BDNF attenuates AD pathology while improving skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, whole-body insulin resistance and facilitating adipocyte browning. Therefore, BDNF may be a viable target for multiple age-related diseases, but more research is required to substantiate this claim, with a particular focus on examining any potential influence of biological sex, as women are at a higher risk for both AD and sarcopenic obesity. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937973/ """,

""" 39188489: Glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) encompass a group of metabolic disorders resulting from deficiencies in enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis or breakdown. Among these, GSD type IX manifests due to a deficiency in phosphorylase kinase enzyme, leading to liver-specific, muscle-specific, or combined forms of the disorder. We present a case report of an exceedingly rare deletion-type mutation in the phosphorylase kinase B (PHKB) gene causing GSD type IXb, offering a comprehensive evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and molecular findings. A one-year and four-month-old male, born of third-degree consanguinity, presented with delayed motor milestones, hypotonicity, short stature, doll-like facies, and hepatosplenomegaly. Preliminary investigations revealed fasting hypoglycemia, ketonuria, elevated liver enzymes, and histological evidence of glycogen accumulation. Whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous deletion encompassing exons 2 to 10 of the PHKB gene, confirming the diagnosis of GSD IXb. GSD IXb due to PHKB mutations is rare, comprising only 10% of liver-specific GSD IX cases.

""" 39767589: Objectives: We aimed to assess the relationship among circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), hypoxia-related proteins, and the conventional risk factors of life-threatening coronary artery disease (CAD) to find more precise novel biomarkers. Methods: Patients were categorized based on coronary CT angiography. Patients with a Segment Involvement Score &gt; 5 were identified as CAD patients. Individuals with a Segment Involvement Score &lt; 5 were considered control subjects. The characterization of EVs and analysis of the plasma concentration of growth differentiation factor-15 were performed using multicolor or bead-based flow cytometry. The plasma protein levels of glycogen phosphorylase, muscle form, clusterin, and carboxypeptidase N subunit 1 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association of the biomarkers with the CAD outcome after accounting for established risk factors. The analysis was built in three steps: first, we included the basic clinical and laboratory variables (Model 1), then we integrated the plasma protein values (Model 2), and finally, we complemented it with the circulating EV pattern (Model 3). To assess the discrimination value of the models, an area under (AUC) the receiver operating curve was calculated and compared across the three models. Results: The area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.68, 0.77, and 0.84 in Models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The variables with the greatest impact on the AUC values were hemoglobin (0.2 (0.16-0.26)) in Model 1, carboxypeptidase N subunit 1 (0.12 (0.09-0.14)) in Model 2, and circulating CD41+/CD61+ EVs (0.31 (0.15-0.5)) in Model 3. A correlation analysis showed a significant impact of circulating CD41+/CD61+ platelet-derived EVs (p = 0.03, r = -0.4176) in Model 3. Conclusions: Based on our results, the circulating EV profile can be used as a supportive biomarker, along with the conventional laboratory markers of CAD, and it enables a more sensitive, non-invasive diagnostic analysis of CAD. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39767589/ """,

""" 39778770: Phospholipids containing oxidized esterified PUFA residues (OxPLs) are increasingly recognized for multiple biological activities and causative involvement in disease pathogenesis. Pharmacokinetics of these compounds in blood plasma is essentially not studied.

The goal of this study was to compare relative activities of different PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes by analyzing cleavage of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (OxPAPC) and oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylethanolamine (OxPAPE) by diluted plasma in the presence of enzyme inhibitors. We have found that human plasma demonstrated high total PLA<sub>2</sub> activity against oxidized PCs and PEs. PAF-AH/Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> played a dominant role in LysoPC and LysoPE production as compared to other enzymes. Molecular species of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine and oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylethanolamine could be divided into three groups according to their degradation rate and sensitivity to PAF-AH/Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor darapladib. Oxidatively truncated species were most rapidly metabolized in the presence of plasma; this process was strongly inhibited by darapladib. The rate of degradation of full-length OxPLs depended on the degree of oxygenation. Species containing 1 to 3 oxygen atoms were relatively stable to degradation in plasma, while OxPLs containing &gt; 3 extra oxygens were degraded but at significantly slower rate than truncated species. In contrast to truncated species, degradation of full-length OxPLs with &gt; 3 extra oxygens were only minimally inhibited by darapladib. These data provide further insights into the mechanisms regulating circulating levels of OxPLs and lipid mediators generated by PLA<sub>2</sub> cleavage of OxPLs, namely oxylipins and LysoPC. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39778770/ """,

In this study, we found that Escherichia coli (E. coli)-induced activation of HKCs led to a rise in cPLA2 mRNA and protein expression, where the ERK and NF-κB pathways were concurrently triggered. Luciferase activity of cPLA2' promoters, PLA2G4A promoters, was enhanced with the stimulation of E. coli or co-transfection with STAT3 or RelB in HKCs. E. coli massively boosted the binding activity of STAT3 and RelB to the specific regions of the PLA2G4A promoter as measured by ChIP-qPCR. The E. coli-ERK-STAT3 and E. coli-non-canonical NF-κB-RelB signaling axes were then identified using pathway inhibitors and transcription factors in the rescue experiments during E. coli-induced HKC activation. In conclusion, we discovered that cPLA2 is necessary for E. coli-induced HKC activation, and the underlying mechanism could be the transcriptional regulation of STAT3 and RelB on the PLA2G4A promoter following the ERK and non-canonical NF-κB signaling activation, implying that the regulation of cPLA2 expression via the E. coli-ERK/non-canonical NF-κB-STAT3/RelB signaling axis could be effective for controlling GNB-induced HKC activation in cirrhotic patients. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39725773/ """,
""" 39332653: The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfamily has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to the multiple physiological and pathological functions exerted by its members. Up to date, the knowledge about the biological role of PLA2XIIA subfamily members remains limited. In this study, a new member of PLA2XIIA subfamily, LcPLA2XIIA, was characterized in large yellow croaker. Different from most members of the PLA2 superfamily with positive charge, LcPLA2XIIA encodes an anionic protein, which is similar to other members of PLA2XIIA subfamily. LcPLA2XIIA is highly expressed in the intestine, and afterwards, it is up-regulated after with Pseudomonas plecoglossicida or Staphylococcus aureus. LcPLA2XIIA exhibits strong inhibitory activity against these two bacteria. The results indicate that LcPLA2XIIA plays an important role in the antimicrobial immune responses of large yellow croaker. LcPLA2XIIA displays strong binding activity to all the tested bacteria. It specifically interacts with LTA, a unique component on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria. It also significantly promotes bacterial agglutination in the presence of Ca2+. These findings reveal that the binding and agglutinating abilities of LcPLA2XIIA to bacteria contribute greatly to its antibacterial activity. In addition, LcPLA2XIIA significantly inhibits the proliferation of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus instead of recombinant human adenovirus type 5. It also suppresses the growth of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis, but it has no obvious inhibitory effect on the growth of epithelioma papulosum cyprinid cells. This study provides new insights into the antibacterial activity, and the mechanism of LcPLA2XIIA in large yellow croaker, and antiviral and antitumor functions of PLA2XIIA subfamily members. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39332653/ """,
""" 39954312: Drug overdose is a pressing global public health challenge, with current detoxification treatments often lacking the broad-spectrum efficacy needed for emergency applications. Inspired by the unique advantages of cell membrane-derived nanodiscs (CNDs), including their compact size, rapid distribution, and preservation of native cell membrane functions, we developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived nanodiscs (ER-NDs) from the ER membranes of mouse hepatic cells for broad-spectrum drug detoxification. ER-NDs retain natural cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, enabling effective detoxification of three model drugs: bupropion, haloperidol, and propranolol. Cell-based assays demonstrated ER-NDs' ability to mitigate drug-induced cytotoxicity, reduce oxidative stress, and restore antioxidant defenses. In mouse models of drug intoxication, ER-ND treatment significantly improved survival rates and alleviated drug-induced oxidative damage. Importantly, ER-NDs showed no evidence of acute toxicity in vivo. These findings underscore the potential of ER-NDs as a versatile platform for broad-spectrum drug detoxification and as a promising tool for managing drug intoxication in emergency and clinical settings. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954312/ """,

""" 39942052: Dietary interventions with food-derived natural products have emerged as a promising strategy to alleviate obesity. This study aims to investigate the anti-obesity effect of Hericium erinaceus protein (HEP) and its underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that HEP exhibited excellent radical scavenging activity in vitro. In vivo, HEP intervention reduced pancreatic lipase activity in the intestine and enhanced fat excretion, thereby inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats. Meanwhile, HEP ameliorated the body weight and organ indexes, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and liver oxidative stress injuries in obese mice. The results of real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses indicated that HEP upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), subsequently upregulated the expression of liver fatty acid oxidation-related genes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT-1a), and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1)) and downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1), and fatty acid synthase (FASN)), thereby ameliorating lipid metabolism disorders.

""" 39948189: Primary MET amplification is an infrequent tumorigenic driver gene alteration identified in pulmonary neoplasms. Data on the effectiveness of MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in de novo MET amplification are relatively scarce, and there remains a dearth of empirical evidence supporting the use of precision therapy as first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary MET amplification. We present a case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma in an elderly patient with primary MET amplification. The patient had an initial ECOG Performance Status (PS) 2. DNA-NGS analysis of tissue samples revealed a MET gene copy number (GCN) of 8, indicating MET amplification, without other oncogenic mutations associated with available drugs being detected. This finding was validated by MET fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which showed cluster amplification. Initial treatment with savolitinib resulted in a sustained partial response lasting more than sixteen months. Our results suggest that savolitinib is effective and safe for the treatment of elderly patients with de novo amplified MET metastatic NSCLC and may therefore be considered a potential treatment option worthy of prospective study confirmation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39948189/ """,

""" 2846839: Hybridization of structural elements of 1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-2-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]quinazoline ring system common to the cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors lixazinone (RS-82856, 1) and anagrelide (3) with complementary features of other PDE inhibitor cardiotonic agents prompted the design and synthesis of the title compounds 7a-d, 11, 12, and 13a,b. The necessary features of these compounds were determined within the framework of the proposed active-site models for the high affinity form of cAMP PDE inhibited by cGMP (type IV). Evaluation of these targets, both in vitro as inhibitors of platelet or cardiac type IV PDE or in vivo as inotropic agents in the pentobarbital-anesthetized dog model of congestive heart failure, showed that these structure possessed negligibly enhanced activities over the parent heterocyclic system, and remained significantly inferior to 1 in all respects. This difference is ascribed to the absence of the N-cyclohexyl-N-methylbutyramidyl-4-oxy side chain of 1. The proposal that the acidic lactam-type functionality, common to the type IV PDE inhibitor inotropic agents such as 4-6 and 8-10, mimics the polarizable cyclic phosphate moiety of cAMP suggested that the side chain of 1 may function as an effective surrogate for selected characteristics of the adenine portion of cAMP. However, the results of this study show that incorporation of adenine-like hydrogen-bonding functionalities common to other type IV PDE inhibitors into the 1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-2-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]quinazoline system did not enhance activity to the levels observed for 1 and analogues. These observations, coupled with the kinetic pattern of inhibition of type IV PDE observed for 1 and analogues, suggest that access to a secondary, lipophilic-tolerant binding site, possibly coincident with the adenine binding domain, and adjacent to the catalytic ribose-phosphate binding site of platelet and cardiac type IV PDE, is responsible for the increased potency of these compounds. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2846839/ """,
""" 22328573: Cyclic nucleotides are critical regulators of synaptic plasticity and participate in requisite signaling cascades implicated across multiple neurotransmitter systems. Phosphodiesterase 9A (PDE9A) is a high-affinity, cGMP-specific enzyme widely expressed in the rodent central nervous system. In the current study, we observed neuronal staining with antibodies raised against PDE9A protein in human cortex, cerebellum, and subiculum. We have also developed several potent, selective, and brain-penetrant PDE9A inhibitors and used them to probe the function of PDE9A in vivo. Administration of these compounds to animals led to dose-dependent accumulation of cGMP in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid, producing a range of biological effects that implied functional significance for PDE9A-regulated cGMP in dopaminergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic neurotransmission and were consistent with the widespread distribution of PDE9A. In vivo effects of PDE9A inhibition included reversal of the respective disruptions of working memory by ketamine, episodic and spatial memory by scopolamine, and auditory gating by amphetamine, as well as potentiation of risperidone-induced improvements in sensorimotor gating and reversal of the stereotypic scratching response to the hallucinogenic 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A agonist mescaline. The results suggested a role for PDE9A in the regulation of monoaminergic circuitry associated with sensory processing and memory. Thus, PDE9A activity regulates neuronal cGMP signaling downstream of multiple neurotransmitter systems, and inhibition of PDE9A may provide therapeutic benefits in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases promoted by the dysfunction of these diverse neurotransmitter systems. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328573/ """,
""" 39742942: Vascular obstruction often causes inadequate oxygen and nutrient supply to the brain. This deficiency results in cerebral ischemic injury, which significantly impairs neurological function. This review aimed to explore the neuroprotective and regenerative effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) in cerebral ischemic injury. NGF, a crucial neurotrophic factor, could inhibit neuronal apoptosis, reduce inflammatory responses, and promote axon regeneration and angiogenesis through its interaction with TrkA, a high-affinity receptor. These functions were closely related to the activation of Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways. Moreover, the mechanisms of NGF in the acute and recovery phases, along with the strategies to enhance its therapeutic effects using delivery systems (such as intranasal administration, nanovesicles, and gene therapy) were also summarized. Although NGF shows great potential for clinical application, its delivery efficiency and long-term safety still need more research and improvements. Future research should focus on exploring the specific action mechanism of NGF, optimizing the delivery strategy, and evaluating its long-term efficacy and safety to facilitate its clinical transformation in cerebral ischemic stroke. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39742942/ """,

""" 39772443: The adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent enzyme ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EAL) catalyzes the conversion of ethanolamine to acetaldehyde and ammonia. As is the case for all AdoCbl-dependent isomerases, the catalytic cycle of EAL is initiated by homolytic cleavage of the cofactor's Co-C bond, producing CoIIcobalamin (CoIICbl) and an adenosyl radical that serves to abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate. Remarkably, in the presence of substrate, the rate of Co-C bond homolysis of enzyme-bound AdoCbl is increased by 12 orders of magnitude. For Class I AdoCbl-dependent isomerases, an important contribution to this rate acceleration stems from a stabilization of the CoIICbl posthomolysis product by the axially coordinated histidine residue that displaces the pendant base from the Co ion upon AdoCbl binding to these enzymes. However, EAL and other Class II isomerases bind AdoCbl in the so-called base-on conformation and must therefore employ a different mechanism of Co-C bond activation. In the present study, we have used a combined spectroscopic and computational approach to probe the conformational changes and enzyme/cofactor/substrate interactions that contribute to the rate acceleration of Co-C bond homolysis in EAL. Spectroscopic data of AdoCbl and CoIICbl show minimal perturbations upon cofactor binding to EAL in both the absence and presence of substrate. Structural models of free and EAL-bound AdoCbl were constructed using molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computations. By carrying out relaxed potential energy scans for Co-C bond cleavage of free and EAL-bound AdoCbl, we identified key cofactor/enzyme interactions that contribute to the Co-C bond activation by EAL and obtained Co-C bond dissociation energies that agree well with published experimental data. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39772443/ """,
