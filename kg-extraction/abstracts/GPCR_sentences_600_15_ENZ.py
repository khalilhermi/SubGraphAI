The patient, a 52-year-old male, was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and received Atezolizumab. Clinical evaluation revealed hyperthyroidism, confirmed by elevated thyroid hormones and autoantibodies (TRAb and TSAb). The patient was managed with methimazole and demonstrated a transient hyperthyroid phase followed by persistent hypothyroidism. Only 16 confirmed cases of Graves' disease induced by ICPi were reported. We conducted a review to investigate the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and prognosis trends associated with ICPi-induced Graves disease in PTAD patients.

""" 39946368: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen that causes mild febrile illness in adults and severe neurological complications and microcephaly in newborns. Studies have reported that ZIKV modulates methylation of human and viral RNA critical for its replication in vertebrate cells. In this study, we show that ZIKV modulates mosquito S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe)-synthase, an enzyme involved in the production of SAMe (methyl donor), and histone methylation for its survival in mosquito cells. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR followed by immunoblotting analysis showed increased amounts of SAMe synthase at both RNA and protein levels, respectively, in C6/36 mosquito cells infected with ZIKV at day 1 post infection (p.i.). Increased levels of SAMe was noted upon ZIKV infection at day 1 p.i in mosquito cells. In addition, increased EZH2 histone methyl transferase-like gene transcripts and methylated histone (H3K27me3) levels were evident in mosquito cells upon ZIKV infection. Exogenous addition of SAMe to mosquito cells showed increased ZIKV loads and EZH2 histone methyl transferase-like gene transcript levels. Furthermore, treatment of mosquito cells with EZH2 inhibitor resulted in reduced histone methylation and ZIKV loads. Collectively, our study provides novel information in understanding the importance of SAMe and histone methylation in the survival of ZIKV in its arthropod vector. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39946368/ """,

Despite its benign clinical course, LyP histologically resembles malignant lymphomas, necessitating careful differentiation. A 42-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of recurring ulcerated papulonodular lesions on her index finger. Histopathological examination revealed atypical CD30+ lymphoid proliferation, confirming LyP type A. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for CD2, CD4, CD30, and MUM-1, while systemic malignancy was excluded. The patient was treated with low-dose methotrexate (15 mg/week), leading to symptom improvement. LyP is classified into five histological subtypes (A-E) and is often misdiagnosed due to its overlap with inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. While the condition typically resolves spontaneously, it is associated with an increased risk of secondary lymphomas, including mycosis fungoides and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

""" 39695854: METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we evaluated 172 datasets, of which 149 concerned patients who were administered methoxyflurane. These datasets were taken from a quality-control survey related to the administration of methoxyflurane by members of the ski patrol in seven ski resorts in the Swiss Alps. The data was collected in the winter months of 2022/23. The ski patrol members had been previously trained by medical professionals and employed methoxyflurane following a defined algorithm, according to which patients with an initial numeric pain score of ≥ 4 qualified for the use of methoxyflurane. After each treatment, data on effectiveness and feasibility were collected by means of a standardised questionnaire. The primary outcome was defined as achieving effective pain therapy, which was designated as a reduction on the numerical rating scale of two or more points and a pain score of seven or less after administration.

Apart from extensive mutation analyses of the MCCC1 and MCCC2 genes encoding 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.4), molecular data on MCC deficiency gene expression studies in human tissues is lacking. For IEMs, unbiased '-omics' approaches are starting to reveal the secondary cellular responses to defects in biochemical pathways. Here we present the first whole genome expression profile of immortalized cultured skin fibroblast cells of two clinically affected MCC deficient patients and two healthy individuals generated using Affymetrix(®)HuExST1.0 arrays. There were 16191 significantly differentially expressed transcript IDs of which 3591 were well annotated and present in the predefined knowledge database of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software used for downstream functional analyses. The most noticeable feature of this MCCA deficient skin fibroblast transcriptome was the typical genetic hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased antioxidant response and disruption of energy homeostasis, which was confirmed by mitochondrial functional analyses. The MCC deficient transcriptome seems to predict oxidative stress that could alter the complex secondary cellular response that involve genes of the glycolysis, the TCA cycle, OXPHOS, gluconeogenesis, β-oxidation and the branched-chain fatty acid metabolism. An important emerging insight from this human MCCA transcriptome in combination with previous reports is that chronic exposure to the primary and secondary metabolites of MCC deficiency and the resulting oxidative stress might impact adversely on the quality of life and energy levels, irrespective of whether MCC deficient individuals are clinically affected or asymptomatic. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27417235/ """,
""" 19706617: 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of leucine catabolism. MCC is a heteromeric mitochondrial enzyme composed of biotin-containing alpha (MCCA) and smaller beta (MCCB) subunits encoded by MCCA and MCCB, respectively. We report studies of the c.1054G-->A mutation in exon 11 of MCCB detected in the homozygous state in a patient with MCC deficiency. Sequence analysis of MCCB cDNA revealed two overlapping transcripts, one containing the normal 73 bp of exon 11 including the missense mutation c.1054G-->A (p.G352R), the other with exon 11 replaced by a 64-bp sequence from intron 10 (cryptic exon 10a) that maintains the reading frame and is flanked by acceptable splice consensus sites. In expression studies, we show that both transcripts lack detectable MCC activity. Western blot analysis showed slightly reduced levels of MCCB using the transcript containing the missense mutation, whereas no MCCB was detected with the transcript containing the cryptic exon 10a. Analysis of the region harboring the mutation revealed that the c.1054G-->A mutation is located in an exon splice enhancer sequence. Using MCCB minigene constructs to transfect MCCB-deficient fibroblasts, we demonstrate that the reduction in utilization of exon 11 associated with the c.1054G-->A mutation is due to alteration of this exon splice enhancer. Further, we show that optimization of the weak splice donor site of exon 11 corrects the splicing defect.

""" 39803428: Itaconate is an immunomodulatory metabolite that alters mitochondrial metabolism and immune cell function. This organic acid is endogenously synthesized via tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism downstream of TLR signaling. Itaconate-based treatment strategies are being explored to mitigate numerous inflammatory conditions. However, little is known about the turnover rate of itaconate in circulation, the kinetics of its degradation, and the broader consequences on metabolism. By combining mass spectrometry and in vivo 13 C itaconate tracing, we demonstrate that itaconate is rapidly eliminated from plasma, excreted via urine, and fuels TCA cycle metabolism specifically in the liver and kidneys. These studies further revealed that itaconate is converted into acetyl-CoA, mesaconate, and citramalate in mitochondria. Itaconate administration also influenced branched-chain amino acid metabolism and succinate levels, indicating a functional impact on succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) activity.

In pheochromocytomas with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors and hyper-IL-6emia, the disease characteristics and relationship between each hormone and cytokine are unknown. Herein, we report a case of a 56-year-old woman with stroke whose computed tomography scans of the abdomen revealed a right adrenal tumor on systemic examination. Endocrinological examination revealed elevated plasma levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in the urine and elevated levels of plasma ACTH, serum cortisol, and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, leading to a diagnosis of right pheochromocytoma and associated ectopic ACTH-producing tumor. Furthermore, hyper-IL-6emia was detected as a key indicator of anemia due to inflammatory hematopoietic disorders. The patient's general condition improved with drug therapy, including 1,000 mg/d of metyrapone, 2 mg/h of phentolamine, 8 mg/d of doxazosin, and systemic management. Dexamethasone suppression tests demonstrated suppressed serum cortisol and IL-6 levels, and dexamethasone dose-dependently increased plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels.

The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of clinically relevant inotropic agents on mucociliary clearance. The particle transport velocity (PTV) of isolated murine tracheae was measured as a surrogate for mucociliary clearance in the presence of dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone. Inhibitory substances were applied to elucidate the signal transduction cascades and the value and origin of calcium ions which provoke alterations in mucociliary clearance function. Dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone increased the PTV in a dose-dependent manner with half maximal effective concentrations of 75.7 nM, 87.0 nM, and 13.7 µM, respectively. After the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, no increase in PTV was observed after administering any of the three inotropic agents. While dobutamine and epinephrine activated β-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine used both the phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathway to promote the release of intracellular Ca2+. However, dobutamine primarily acted on the PKA pathway, having only a minor influence on the PLC pathway. The induced changes in PTV following milrinone administration required both the PKA and PLC pathway, although the PKA pathway was responsible for most of the induced changes.

""" 39157962: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained tachyarrhythmia in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Recently, it has been discovered that oxidative stress is an important contributor to AF. Therefore, antioxidant therapies for AF have great potential for clinical applications. Methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid residue other than cysteine, is recognized as a functional redox switch, which could be rescued from the reversible oxidation of methionine sulfoxide by methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA). S-Methyl-L-cysteine (SMLC), a natural analogue of Met, which is abundantly found in garlic and cabbage, could substitute for Met oxidations and mediate MsrA to scavenge free radicals. However, whether SMLC alleviates AF is unclear. This study aims to clarify the effects of SMLC on AF and elucidate the underlying pharmacological and molecular mechanisms. In vivo, SMLC (70, 140 and 280 mg kg-1 day-1) was orally administered to mice for 4 weeks with angiotensin II (Ang II) by subcutaneous infusion using osmotic pumps to induce AF. Ang II significantly prompted high AF susceptibility and atrial remodeling characterized by oxidative stress, conductive dysfunction and fibrosis. SMLC played a remarkable protective role in Ang II-induced atrial remodeling dose-dependently. Moreover, RNA sequencing was performed on atrial tissues to identify the differentially expressed mRNA, which was to screen out MSRA, CAMK2 and MAPK signaling pathways. Western blots confirmed that Ang II-induced downregulation of MsrA and upregulation of oxidized CaMKII (ox-CaMKII) and p38 MAPK could be reversed in a concentration-dependent manner by SMLC. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, HL-1 cells (mouse atria-derived cardiomyocytes) treated with Ang II were used for an in vitro model. SMLC alleviated Ang II-induced cytotoxicity, mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress. Additionally, knockdown MsrA could attenuate the protective effects of SMLC, which were eliminated by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. In summary, the present study demonstrates that SMLC protects against atrial remodeling in AF by inhibiting oxidative stress through the mediation of the MsrA/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39157962/ """,
""" 39954107: D. nervosa is a wild perennial herb used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, and digestive disorders. Its primary bioactive components are flavonoids, phenolic acids, and sesquiterpenes. However, bioactive peptides, which exhibit a wide range of biological activities and are commonly found in both animals and plants, have not been reported in D. nervosa to date. To investigate the presence and potential bioactivities of bioactive peptides in D. nervosa, the abundance of endogenous peptides was initially analyzed using a Nano-LC-Q Exactive Plus quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Subsequently, bioinformatics screening, computational enzyme hydrolysis, target-pathway-disease network prediction, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate safety, biological activity prediction and investigate the potential anticancer mechanisms of D. nervosa. The results demonstrate that the simulated enzymatic hydrolysates of D. nervosa endogenous peptide target and bind to cancer pathway receptor proteins such as MMP9, MAPK1, SRC, and PI3KCA, indicating their potential anticancer activity.

This study aimed to develop selective JNK3 inhibitors based on a pyrazole scaffold, focusing on (E)-1-(2-aminopyrimidin-4-yl)-4-styryl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide derivatives. Through systematic structural modifications and extensive SAR analysis, we identified compounds 24a and 26a as highly potent JNK3 inhibitors, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 12 and 19 nM, respectively. Especially, 24a revealed its potent and selective inhibition of JNK3, coupled with inhibition of the GSK3α/β kinases involved in Tau phosphorylation. In vitro studies revealed significant neuroprotective effects against Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced toxicity in primary neuronal cells and western blot analyses confirmed the compounds' ability to mitigate Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced c-Jun and APP phosphorylation, suggesting a multi-faceted approach to neuroprotection. Docking studies validated the retention of optimal interactions within the JNK3 binding pocket.

""" 39719774: Heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs) play important roles in plant developmental regulations and various abiotic stress responses. However, their evolutionary mechanism of freezing tolerance remains poorly understood. In our previous transcriptomics study based on DNA methylation sequencing, the BnaHsfA2 was found to be significantly accumulated in winter rapeseed (Brassica rapa L.) under freezing stress, and the expression levels of BnaHsfA2 showed a gradual increasing trend over three years. In this study, BnaHsfA2 was isolated and characterized. Its' encoding protein has a relatively high phylogenetic relationship with the AtHsfA2; Subcellular localization results indicated that BnaHsfA2 was a nuclear protein; BnaHsfA2 exhibited higher expression levels in mature seed coats and seeds, seedling leaves, flowering filaments as well as anthers. The transcription level of BnaHsfA2 in leaves of rapeseed seedling was significantly increased at -4 °C stress for 12h and 24h. BnaHsfA2 promoter has many stress-responsive cis-regulatory elements. β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining assays indicated that the BnaHsfA2 promoter was induced under freezing stress, and it's 5'-deletion fragment from 465 to 1284 was essential for the transcriptional expression in response to freezing stress. The BnaHsfA2-transgenic rapeseed lines showed greater freezing resistance in comparison with the wild type (WT); the BnaHsfA2 overexpression lines showed increased antioxidant enzyme activities, decreased level of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation compared to the WT. Finally, yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that BnaHsfA2 interacted with rapeseed mitogen-activated protein kinase 11 (BnaMPK11) and heat shock factor-binding protein (BnaHsp70). The study will pave the way for further understanding the regulatory networks of BnaHsfA2 in plants under abiotic stress. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39719774/ """,
""" 39871031: Sorafenib (Sora) is a first-line treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It can significantly improve the survival rate of patients with advanced HCC, but it is prone to drug resistance during treatment, so the therapeutic effect is extremely limited. Here, we demonstrate that an elevated expression of protein kinase p38γ in hepatocellular carcinoma cells diminishes the tumor cells' sensitivity to Sora. Pirfenidone (PFD) can augment Sora's inhibitory effect on hepatocellular carcinoma by specifically targeting p38γ. Our study further uncovers that pirfenidone can synergistically boost the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma impact of Sora by impeding the autophagy heightened by p38γ. Taken together, our findings suggest that pirfenidone can work in concert with Sora to intensify its anti-tumor effect on hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby offering a novel therapeutic approach for Sora-mediated tumor treatment. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39871031/ """,
""" 39196141: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a leading immediate cause of sudden cardiac death. There is a strong association between aging and VF, although the mechanisms are unclear, limiting the availability of targeted therapeutic interventions. Here we found that the stress kinases p38γ and p38δ are activated in the ventricles of old mice and mice with genetic or drug-induced arrhythmogenic conditions. We discovered that, upon activation, p38γ and p38δ cooperatively increase the susceptibility to stress-induced VF. Mechanistically, our data indicate that activated p38γ and p38δ phosphorylate ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) disrupt Kv4.3 channel localization, promoting sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak, I<sub>to</sub> current reduction and action potential duration prolongation. In turn, this led to aberrant intracellular calcium handling, premature ventricular complexes and enhanced susceptibility to VF. Blocking this pathway protected genetically modified animals from VF development and reduced the VF duration in aged animals. These results indicate that p38γ and p38δ are a potential therapeutic target for sustained VF prevention. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39196141/ """,
""" 39865029: Activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways is vital in regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress response, significantly affecting tumorigenesis and cancer progression. We developed a bioinformatic technique to construct an interactome network-based molecular pathways for genes of interest and quantify their activation levels using high-throughput gene expression data. This study is focused on the p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ kinases, examining their activation levels (PALs) based on transcriptomic data and their associations with survival and drug responsiveness across various cancer types. We analyzed 11,287 human tumor profiles from 31 cancer types and 53 datasets to assess patient survival and clinical response to 29 therapies. Activation of p38 pathways showed varying prognostic significance depending on the cancer type. In astrocytoma, glioblastoma, thymoma, renal, bladder, esophageal, colorectal, stomach cancers, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, p38 pathway activation correlated with poor survival. Conversely, it indicated better survival in the gender-associated tumors (HER2+, luminal A and B subtypes of breast cancer, prostate carcinoma), sarcomas, lung adenocarcinoma, and others. These trends are aligned with the response-to-therapy analysis. For instance, higher activation of the p38β and p38γ pathways was linked to positive responses to taxane and anthracycline therapies in breast cancer, while lower activation of the p38α and p38β pathways correlated with better responses to 5-fluorouracil-based treatments in colorectal cancer. However, associations with individual MAPK14, MAPK11, MAPK12, and MAPK13 gene expression levels were less robust. Hence, the p38 pathway activation levels could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes and personalizing treatment strategies, including use of the selective p38 MAPK inhibitors. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39865029/ """,
""" 39949939: Natural compounds are an invaluable source for bioactive small molecules. Cellular activities modulated by them are generally achieved by binding specific cellular targets. However, identification of target(s) for a natural compound is challenging and a hurdle for further development of them as drugs. Sinensetin is derived from Schisandra sphenanthera and the major component of a traditional medicine. Although Sinensetin possesses pharmacological activities, including antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer, the molecular mechanisms for its activities remain unclear due to lack of information for its target. In addition, the anticancer effects of sinensetin against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not been studied. Here, we described sinensetin as a specific inhibitor of MKK6 with a KD value of 66.27 μM. Sinensetin inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells and lung patient-derived xenograft-derived organoids (LPDXO), and induced G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Sinensetin attenuated the MAPK signaling pathway by directly inhibiting MKK6, but not MKK3. In silico molecular docking analysis indicated that sinensetin was specifically bound near the αG-helix of MKK6, but not MKK3. High MKK6 expression levels were observed in NSCLC patients. MKK6 knockout abolished the sinensetin-mediated inhibition of NSCLC cell proliferation.

""" 39934802: Mast cells develop from the myeloid lineage and are released from the bone marrow as immature cells, which then differentiate at the destination tissue based on cues from the local environment. In the liver, mast cells are recruited in diseased states to fibrogenic surroundings rich in TGF-β1. The aim of this study was to investigate TGF-β1 signaling in primary and permanent mast cells to identify common and unique mechanisms. The TGF-β receptor repertoire is similar among mast cells, with high expression of type I and type II receptors and very low expression of type III receptors (Betaglycan and Endoglin). Downstream, TGF-β1 activates the SMAD2/3 signaling axis and also SMAD1/5 with target genes Smad6 and Id1 in a transient manner. Initially, TGF-β1 upregulates the transcription of mucosal mast cell effectors Mcpt1 and Mcpt2 in all analyzed mast cells. This upregulation is reduced in the presence of IL-3, which promotes proliferation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation reduces proliferation and mitigates the negative effect of IL-3 on Mcpt1 mRNA and protein expression in the immortalized mast cell line PMC-306 but not in bone marrow-derived mast cells. Therefore, extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2 are identified as a mutual switch between IL-3-driven proliferation and TGF-β1-promoted mucosal mast cell differentiation in PMC-306. In conclusion, TGF-β1 promotes a mucosal gene signature and inhibits proliferation in mast cells, with these effects being counter-regulated by IL-3/ERK1/2. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39934802/ """,
""" 39956209: Neutrophil dysregulation is implicated in a spectrum of inflammatory pathologies, suggesting the potential for targeting neutrophilic hyperactivation as a pharmacological strategy to manage inflammatory disorders. Building upon prior research where 2-thiolphenoxychromone derivatives were found to inhibit neutrophilic generation of superoxide anions, this study focused on exploring the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of different C2 bridging moieties and anti-inflammatory effects using bioisosteric replacements and scaffold-hopping approaches. Among various chemotypes, the N-(4-oxo-4H-chromen-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide derivatives emerged as robust inhibitors of both superoxide anion generation and elastase release from fMLF-activated human neutrophils, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the single-digit micromolar range. Leveraging a forward pharmacology approach through computational prediction, compound 15b, a representative within this active molecular class, was discovered to exert these anti-inflammatory functions by blocking the p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. This responded to a significant reduction in p38α MAPK and its downstream MK2 phosphorylation in activated neutrophils treated with 15b, with no apparent impact on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation levels. Additionally, this molecule exhibited inhibitory potential on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, granule exocytosis, and chemotactic responses. Collectively, this study provides a novel skeleton for the development of inhibitors targeting the p38α MAPK pathway to mitigate neutrophilic inflammation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956209/ """,

At three time points of 7, 10, and 14 days after irradiation with 5J/cm2 LED red light, the expression levels of early to middle-stage osteogenic-related genes ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR(qRT-PCR) in both control and osteogenesis experimental groups. The addition of BIX02189 could block the ERK5 signaling pathway. Under irradiation with 5J/cm2 LED red light, the expression levels of the ERK5 gene, related proteins ERK5, p-ERK5, as well as early to middle-stage osteogenic-related genes ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot in the osteogenic medium group and the osteogenic medium + BIX02189 group.  RESULTS: Both low-energy LED red light and osteogenic medium could induce osteogenesis and differentiation of PDLSCs, upregulating the expression of ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN genes in PDLSCs.

Expression of fate-determinant transcription factors is essential for specification of their distinct identities. However, the mechanisms downstream of fate-determinant factors coordinating different aspects of neuron identity are not understood. Specifically, how distinct projection neurons develop appropriate dendritic arbors that determine their inputs is unknown.

We identified a mechanism linking the corticospinal/corticofugal identity gene Fezf2 with the regulation of dendritic development. We show that miR-193b∼365 microRNA cluster is regulated by Fezf2 and enriched in corticospinal neurons. miR-193b∼365 represses mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) to regulate corticospinal dendritic development. miR-193b∼365 overexpression in callosal neurons abnormally reduces MAPK8 signal and dendritic complexity.

After undergoing sequential immunotherapy including corticosteroid, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab, her Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score improved from 28.5 to 18, demonstrating partial recovery. This case highlights the necessity of considering an autoimmune etiology in patients presenting with subacute cerebellar ataxia and suggests that testing for ARHGAP26-IgG is warranted also when psychocognitive impairment is clinically evident. Early initiation of immunotherapy is important to enhance patient outcomes. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955926/ """,

""" 39956473: Histones are nuclear proteins that play a key role in chromatin assembly and regulation of gene expression by their ability to bind to DNA. Histones can also be released from cells owing to necrosis or extracellular trap release from neutrophils (NETs) and other immune cells. The presence of histones in the extracellular environment has implications for many pathologies, including diabetes mellitus, owing to the cytotoxic nature of these proteins, and their ability to promote inflammation. NETs also contain myeloperoxidase, a defensive enzyme that produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl), to kill pathogens, but also readily damages host proteins. In this study, we examined the reactivity of histones with and without HOCl modification, with a pancreatic β-cell model. Exposure of β-cells to histones resulted in a loss of metabolic activity and cell death by a combination of apoptosis and necrosis. This toxicity was increased on pretreatment of the β-cells with tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β. Histones upregulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes, including the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP. There was also evidence for alterations to the cellular redox environment and upregulation of antioxidant gene expression. However, downregulation of insulin-associated genes and insulin was observed. Interestingly, modification of the histones with HOCl reduced their toxicity and altered the patterns of gene expression observed, and a further decrease in the expression of insulin-associated genes was observed. These findings could be relevant to the development of Type 2 diabetes, where low-grade inflammation favours NET release, resulting in elevated histones in the circulation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956473/ """,

""" 39956261: Lithospermic acid (LA), a plant-derived polycyclic phenolic carboxylic acid, is known for its strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, its effects have not yet been studied in ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to assess the protective effects of LA in UC and investigate its potential mechanisms of action. Our findings indicated that LA effectively mitigated oxidative stress in mice with colitis by increasing the production of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), while reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (p<0.05 for all). In NCM460 cells, LA inhibited the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in ROS and preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that LA decreased the production of inflammatory markers (p<0.05). Additionally, LA upregulated intestinal mucosal proteins, contributing to mucosal barrier repair. Mechanistically, LA activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling pathway, increasing the expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) while inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation (p<0.05). Notably, the inhibition of Nrf2 reversed the protective effects of LA against colitis. Molecular docking analyses support a strong interaction between Nrf2 and LA. LA mitigates colitis-related inflammation and oxidative stress mainly by activating the Nrf2 signalling pathway. These findings support the potential development of LA as a novel therapeutic agent for UC. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956261/ """,

""" 37127927: RESULTS: The contents of citric acid and malic acid increased greatly during fruit development, while quinic acid content decreased obviously. Significant positive correlations were observed between fruit titratable acidity and the contents of both citric acid and malic acid, and a significant negative correlation was found between fruit titratable acidity and the quinic acid content. The high accumulation of citric acid was found to be caused by the increased activity of citrate synthase (CS), and the decreased activities of two degradation-related enzymes, mitochondrial aconitase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. In addition, the accumulation of malic acid depended mainly on the increased synthesis catalyzed by NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Further analysis suggested that AeCS2 and AeMDH2 played pivotal roles in controlling the activities of CS and NAD-MDH respectively. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37127927/ """,

""" 39956520: Inhibiting post-acidification while preserving viable probiotics in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) fermentation is pivotal to preserving quality and probiotic benefits. In this study, following high-pressure processing (HPP) at 400 and 500 MPa for 600 s, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum entered the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. Resuscitation curves, pH levels, acid generation, and glucose metabolism were monitored at 4 °C. VBNC L. plantarum began resuscitation on Day 6 and reached stationary phase by Days 24-27. Glucose metabolism decreased significantly, with no detectable pH drop or acid production, indicating post-acidification was delayed by at least 24 days. Mechanistic insights revealed that post-acidification inhibition was due to HPP-disrupted riboflavin metabolism, related to the cellular respiratory chain and downgraded ATP-depended biosynthesis of NADH, a key coenzyme for lactic acid production. Ultimately, HPP-induced VBNC L. plantarum effectively prevented post-acidification and preserved alive L. plantarum in fermented tomato sauce, verified its ability in real foods. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956520/ """,
""" 39902331: The primary effector cells involved in the formation of hypertrophic scars are fibroblasts. A potential peptide, ADSCP2 (adipose-derived stem cell peptide 2, the peptide fragment of ALCAM protein), derived from adipose-derived stem cell-conditioned medium, has been identified as having the potential to mitigate hypertrophic scar formation by targeting pyruvate carboxylase. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Whether ADSCP2 attenuates hypertrophic scar fibrosis at the transcription level remains unclear. Consequently, this study sought to elucidate the potential mechanism associated with ADSCP2 by examining genome-wide transcriptional alterations and changes in chromatin accessibility in fibroblasts. This was achieved through the integrated analysis of assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In the ADSCP2 treatment group, ATAC-seq identified a total of 7,805 differential peaks associated with 3,176 genes. RNA-seq analysis revealed 345 upregulated and 399 downregulated transcripts in the same group. A combined Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of both downregulated genes and close-ACRs (accessible chromatin regions) genes within the ADSCP2 treatment group indicated regulation of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OXPHOS) by ADSCP2. The amalgamation of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data elucidates that two OXPHOS associated genes, namely COX6B1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1) and NDUFA1 (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) alpha subcomplex-1), demonstrate significant downregulation in the presence of ADSCP2. Further analysis using the integrative genomics viewer indicates that the promoter regions of both COX6B1 and NDUFA1 exhibit a higher degree of closure in the ADSCP2 treatment group. Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that ADSCP2 treatment resulted in a reduction of COX6B1 and NDUFA1 mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, cellular ATP and lactic acid concentrations were diminished in the ADSCP2-treated group. Collectively, these findings suggest potential avenues for future research into the therapeutic application of the peptide ADSCP2 in the treatment of hypertrophic scars. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39902331/ """,
""" 34732331: Of the 57 human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes, seven are mitochondrial: 11A1, 11B1, 11B2, 24A1, 27A1, 27B1, and 27C1. Mitochondrial P450s utilize an electron transport system with adrenodoxin (Adx) and NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase (AdR). AdR reduces Adx, which then transfers electrons to the P450. The interactions between proteins in the mitochondrial P450 system are largely driven by electrostatic interactions, though the specifics vary depending on the P450. Unlike other mitochondrial P450s, the interaction between P450 27C1, a retinoid 3,4-desaturase expressed in the skin, and Adx remains largely uncharacterized. In this work, we utilized an Alexa Fluor 488 C<sub>5</sub> maleimide-labeled Adx to measure binding affinities between Adx and P450 27C1 or AdR. Both proteins bound Adx tightly, with K<sub>d</sub> values &lt; 100 nM, and binding affinities decreased with increasing ionic strength, supporting the role of electrostatic interactions in mediating these interactions. Cross-linking mass spectrometry and computational modeling were performed to identify interactions between P450 27C1 and Adx. While the residues of Adx identified in interactions were consistent with studies of other mitochondrial P450s, the binding interface of P450 27C1 was quite large and supported multiple Adx binding positions, including ones outside of the canonical Adx binding site. Additionally, Adx did not appear to be an allosteric effector of P450 27C1 substrate binding, in contrast to some other mitochondrial P450s. Overall, we conclude that P450-Adx interactions are P450-specific. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34732331/ """,
""" 39888528: Trophic factors, such as neurotrophins, are fundamental for cellular processes including differentiation, growth, survival, and regeneration. These molecules exhibit significant morphological and phylogenetic conservation throughout the animal kingdom, indicating conserved functions. In fish, the oldest and most diverse group of vertebrates, neurotrophins, and their receptors play pivotal roles not only within the central nervous system but also in various peripheral tissues. They are distributed in mechanosensory, muscle, skin, respiratory, circulatory, digestive, endocrine, urinary, reproductive, and immune systems, suggesting their involvement in the development and maintenance of all tissues/organs/systems. Despite this broad distribution, studies focusing on these molecules outside of the central nervous system have been limited to just 12 fish species. These investigations have revealed diverse expression patterns across different ages and tissues/organs/systems, expanding our comprehension of their functions beyond the central and peripheral nervous systems. Notably, BDNF and NT-3 are prominently expressed outside the central nervous system, particularly in mechanosensory and digestive tissues, whereas NGF is predominantly observed in mechanosensory and urinary systems. The expression and localization of neurotrophins and their receptors vary among organs, underscoring tissue-specific roles. Further research is imperative to decipher the precise functions and mechanisms of action of neurotrophins and their receptors in diverse fish tissues.

""" 39795121: Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including ionizing radiation treatment, are increasingly recognized as an effective method for the degradation of pharmaceutical pollutants, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Nabumetone (NAB), a widely used NSAID prodrug, poses an environmental risk due to its persistence in aquatic ecosystems and its potential toxicity to non-target organisms. In this study, the radiolytic degradation of NAB was investigated under different experimental conditions (dose rate, radical scavenging, pH, matrix effect), and the toxicity of its degradation products was evaluated. NAB was rapidly degraded at 300 Gy with prolonged irradiation. Mineralization of about 88% of NAB solutions was observed based on the evaluation of total organic carbon (TOC). The most efficient degradation of NAB occurred under N<sub>2</sub>O conditions, while it was retarded in the presence of thiourea. The water matrix components had a significant influence on the efficiency of degradation. In addition, the main degradation products were identified by LC-HRMS. Toxicity studies on different bacteria showed no significant impact of the NAB degradation products, while in silico predictive methods revealed their slightly increased toxicity compared to the parent compound, but considerably lower toxicity in comparison to its main active form 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (MNA). Additionally, significantly lower toxicities are predicted for degradation products in N<sub>2</sub>O saturated solution. These results underline the importance of optimizing irradiation parameters for effective degradation and minimizing the formation of harmful by-products. Understanding all aspects of the AOP processes and the toxicological effects of the degradation products ensures effective mitigation of potential environmental and health risks of water treatment processes. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39795121/ """,

In response to endotoxemia, global PC1/3 knockout mice mount a cytokine storm and die rapidly. Further, immune cells isolated from these mice have a pro-inflammatory signature, suggesting that PC1/3 activates an unknown anti-inflammatory peptide precursor in immune cells. Here, we tested this hypothesis using tissue-specific PC1/3 ablation models. Knocking out PC1/3 in the myeloid or the hematopoietic compartment did not induce any phenotype. In contrast, proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-specific PC1/3 knockout mice phenocopied global PC1/3 knockout mice, including an enlarged spleen size and a hyperinflammatory sepsis phenotype in response to mild endotoxemia. This phenotype was prevented by steroid therapy and mimicked by blocking corticoid receptors in wild-type mice. Thus, our data suggest that sepsis hypersensitivity in PC1/3 deficiency is uncoupled from immune cell intrinsic PC1/3 expression and is driven by a lack of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids due to an impairment in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39435302/ """,
