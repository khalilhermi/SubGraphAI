""" 39938083: Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) gene cause the most common recessive type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), CMT-SORD. However, the full genotype-phenotype spectrum and progression of the disease remain to be defined. Notably, a multicenter phase 2/3 study to test the efficacy of govorestat (NCT05397665), a new aldose reductase inhibitor, is currently ongoing. Diagnosing CMT-SORD will become imperative when disease-modifying therapies become available. In this cross-sectional multicentre study, we identified 144 patients from 126 families, including 99 males (69%) and 45 females (31%). Patients represented multiple ancestries, including European, Hispanic, Chinese, Near Eastern, and Northern African. We confirmed c.757delG (p.Ala253GlnfsTer27) as the most common pathogenic allele, followed by c.458C>A (p.Ala153Asp), while other variants were identified mostly in single cases. The average sorbitol level in CMT-SORD patients was significantly higher compared to controls and heterozygous carriers, independently from serum storage duration, sex, or variant type. Two-thirds of cases were diagnosed with CMT2 while one-third had distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). Disease onset was usually in the second decade of life. Although foot dorsiflexion was the most affected muscle group, dorsal and plantar flexion had a similar degree of weakness in most cases (difference of Medical Research Council score ≤ 1). One fourth of patients used ankle foot orthoses, usually in their 30s, but most patients maintained independent ambulation later in life. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were suggestive of a motor predominant axonal neuropathy, with reduced conduction velocities in the intermediate range in one fourth of the cases. Sensory conductions in the upper limbs appeared more frequently affected than in the lower limbs. Foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion decreased significantly with age. Male sex was significantly associated with the severity of distal lower limb weakness (plantar flexion) and a larger change over time (dorsiflexion). In conclusion, CMT-SORD is a frequent recessive form of axonal, motor predominant CMT, with prominent foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion involvement. Fasting serum sorbitol is a reliable biomarker of the condition that can be utilized for pathogenicity assessment of identified rare SORD variants. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39938083/ """,

""" 39923924: Sphingolipids are critical components of cellular membranes that play a pivotal role in modulating ion channel function by forming lipid rafts that stabilize and localize these channels. These lipids regulate membrane fluidity and protein-lipid interactions, directly influencing ion channel activity, trafficking, and signaling pathways essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Despite their fundamental role, the impact of sphingolipids on ion channel functionality, particularly within the nervous system, remains insufficiently understood. This study addresses this gap by examining the influence of sphingolipids on transient receptor potential canonical 5 (TRPC5), a key brain ion channel involved in sensory transduction and linked to conditions such as obesity, anxiety, and postpartum depression when disrupted. In this study, we demonstrate that TRPC5 is localized within lipid rafts. Inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis through myrioncin (Myr), the sphingomyelin synthase 2 inhibitor Ly93, or D,L-erythro-PDMP hydrochloride (PMDP) significantly disrupts TRPC5 localization at the plasma membrane. Treatment with lipid raft disruptors methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) or sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), in conjunction with sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors, led to decreased TRPC5-mediated calcium flux and currents. This highlights the critical importance of TRPC5 localization in lipid rafts for its functionality. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS-based sphingolipidomics has shown that a balanced sphingolipid profile is crucial for channel function. Alterations in sphingolipid metabolism, especially the deficiency of sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids, may primarily disrupt lipid raft structure. Interactions between amino acid residues with phenyl ring side chains and lipids at the inner and outer plasma membrane edges serve as 'fixators', anchoring TRPC5 channels within lipid rafts. Given the structural similarities among TRP channels, we propose that sphingolipid metabolic homeostasis may universally influence TRP channel activity, potentially explaining diverse neurological disorder phenotypes associated with sphingolipid metabolism disruptions. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39923924/ """,
""" 39869140: Recently, there has been burgeoning interest in the involvement of cholesterol metabolism in cancer. Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), as a critical rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, has garnered attention due to its overexpression in various cancer types, thereby significantly impacting tumor prognosis and resistance mechanisms. Firstly, SQLE contributes to unfavorable prognosis through diverse mechanisms, encompassing modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, manipulation of the cancer microenvironment, and participation in ferroptosis. Secondly, directing efforts towards targeting SQLE, via mechanisms such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, presents promising avenues for overcoming resistance to conventional therapies such as endocrine cancer therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy. Moreover, the effectiveness of SQLE protein inhibitors in impeding cancer progression may either depend directly on SQLE inhibition or function through alternative pathways separate from SQLE. This mini-review offers insights into the intricate mechanisms through which SQLE affects the prognosis and resistance profiles across diverse cancer types, while succinctly elucidating the mechanisms underpinning the anticancer effects of SQLE protein inhibitors. Furthermore, this mini-review underscores the necessity for further investigations into the interplay between SQLE and cancer, proposing potential avenues for future research, with the aim of serving as a reference for exploring the mechanisms governing the role of SQLE in cancer regulation. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39869140/ """,

""" 20301583: CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease characterized by infantile-onset diarrhea, childhood-onset cataract, adolescent- to young adult-onset tendon xanthomas, and adult-onset progressive neurologic dysfunction (dementia, psychiatric disturbances, pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs, dystonia, atypical parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, and seizures). Chronic diarrhea from infancy and/or neonatal cholestasis may be the earliest clinical manifestation. In approximately 75% of affected individuals, cataracts are the first finding, often appearing in the first decade of life. Xanthomas appear in the second or third decade; they occur on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand, the patellar tendon, and the neck tendons. Xanthomas have been reported in the lung, bones, and central nervous system. Some individuals show cognitive impairment from early infancy, whereas the majority have normal or only slightly impaired intellectual function until puberty; dementia with slow deterioration in intellectual abilities occurs in the third decade in more than 50% of individuals. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as behavioral changes, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, depression, and suicide attempts may be prominent. Pyramidal signs (i.e., spasticity) and/or cerebellar signs almost invariably become evident between ages 20 and 30 years. The biochemical abnormalities that distinguish CTX from other conditions with xanthomas include high plasma and tissue cholestanol concentration, normal-to-low plasma cholesterol concentration, decreased chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), increased concentration of bile alcohols and their glyconjugates, and increased concentrations of cholestanol and apolipoprotein B in cerebrospinal fluid. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20301583/ """,

""" 20301583: MANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Long-term treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) normalizes plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentration of cholestanol and improves neurophysiologic findings. Supportive treatment: Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase alone or in combination with CDCA are also effective in decreasing cholestanol concentration and improving clinical signs; however, they may induce muscle damage. Cholic acid treatment decreases cholestanol levels and improves neurologic symptoms in the few individuals in whom it has been tried and may be useful in those who experience side effects with CDCA treatments. Cataract extraction is typically required in at least one eye by age 50 years. Epilepsy, spasticity, and parkinsonism are treated symptomatically. Surveillance: Annual cholestanol plasma concentration, neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation, brain MRI, echocardiogram, and assessment of bone density. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Caution has been suggested with statins. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of CDCA treatment and surveillance.

""" 39769453: Aging and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) are the two most significant risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Compared to APOE3, APOE4 disrupts cholesterol homeostasis, increases cholesteryl esters (CEs), and exacerbates neuroinflammation in brain cells, including microglia. Targeting CEs and neuroinflammation could be a novel strategy to ameliorate APOE4-dependent phenotypes. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key macromolecule in inflammation, and its regulation is associated with the cholesterol content of lipid rafts in cell membranes. We previously demonstrated that in normal microglia expressing APOE3, inhibiting the cholesterol storage enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1/SOAT1) reduces CEs, dampened neuroinflammation via modulating the fate of TLR4. We also showed that treating myelin debris-loaded normal microglia with ACAT inhibitor F12511 reduced cellular CEs and activated ABC transporter 1 (ABCA1) for cholesterol efflux. This study found that treating primary microglia expressing APOE4 with F12511 also reduces CEs, activates ABCA1, and dampens LPS-dependent NFκB activation. In vivo, two-week injections of nanoparticle F12511, which consists of DSPE-PEG<sub>2000</sub>, phosphatidylcholine, and F12511, to aged female APOE4 mice reduced TLR4 protein content and decreased proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β in mice brains.

""" 39805872: Immune functions decline with aging, leading to increased susceptibility to various diseases including tumors. Exploring aging-related molecular targets in elderly patients with cancer is thus highly sought after. Here we find that an ER transmembrane enzyme, sterol O-acyltransferase 2 (SOAT2), is overexpressed in regulatory T (Treg) cells from elderly patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), while radiomics analysis of LSCC patients associates increased SOAT2 expression with reduced immune infiltration and poor prognosis. Mechanically, ex vivo human and mouse Treg cell data and in vivo mouse tumor models suggest that SOAT2 overexpression in Treg cells promotes cholesterol metabolism by activating the SREBP2-HMGCR-GGPP pathway, leading to enhanced Treg suppresser functions but reduced CD8+ T cell proliferation, migration, homeostasis and anti-tumor immunity. Our study thus identifies a potential mechanism responsible for altered Treg function in the context of immune aging, and also implicates SOAT2 as a potential target for tumor immunotherapy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39805872/ """,

The etiology is multifactorial, with iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease being the main reasons. Other causes include vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate deficiency, hemolytic anemia and medications such as azathioprine and sulfasalazine. Apart from physical symptoms, it is associated with several negative outcomes, including poor quality of life, increased risk of hospital admission, increased risk of surgery and higher treatment costs. Diagnostic evaluation aims to identify the underlying cause and severity to determine the appropriate therapeutic strategy. Investigations include a complete blood count, iron indices, inflammatory markers and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate levels. Patients with iron deficiency need adequate replacement therapy to improve hemoglobin and replenish iron stores. Those with moderate to severe anemia and/or active disease need intravenous iron, while mild anemia can be treated with oral iron. Multiple parenteral iron formulations are available which differ in dose and frequency of administration. Traditional oral iron supplements are available in ferrous forms, which, although effective, are associated with gastrointestinal side effects. Newer oral iron formulations have helped reduce these adverse effects but are expensive. Anemia of chronic disease is mainly driven by the effects of inflammatory mediators on iron metabolism and erythropoiesis and treatment requires control of disease activity. Relapse of anemia after therapy is frequent; hence, patients need to be closely followed up for early detection and appropriate management. Significant advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of anemia in IBD and better and safer iron formulations are available. However, a significant proportion of IBD patients with anemia go undetected or untreated and there is a need for improved recognition and better management practices.

""" 39837223: SLC17A3 localized to the apical membrane of the renal proximal tubules has been implicated in the urinary excretion of drugs and endogenous/exogenous metabolites transported into the tubules by OAT1 and OAT3. Because SLC17A3 mediates the facilitated diffusion of organic anions, which requires a sensitive and rapid assay, no system has been established to evaluate its transport activity in mammalian cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the exposure of cells expressing click beetle luciferase (bLuc) and SLC17A3 to D-luciferin produces marked bioluminescence, which enables the evaluation of SLC17A3 function. The bioluminescence intensity increased under depolarized membrane potential conditions, consistent with the unique feature of SLC17A3 as a voltage-dependent organic anion transporter. SLC17A3-mediated bioluminescence was saturable with an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K<sub>m</sub>) of 8.1 μM. The inhibitory effects of various compounds including OAT1/OAT3 substrates and inhibitors on bioluminescence were in good agreement with those reported in SLC17A3-expressing Xenopus oocytes using radio-labeled substrates. Interestingly, we found that sulfinpyrazone and lesinurad, uricosuric drugs that inhibit SLC22A12/URAT1, are potent SLC17A3 inhibitors, suggesting the possibility that they alter the pharmacokinetics of OAT1/OAT3-substrate drugs and urate. Taken together, the bioluminescence-based SLC17A3 functional assay is robust and reliable. This strategy enables the study of its transport activity and the identification of potential SLC17A3-mediated drug-drug interactions.

Additionally, liver microsomal and cytosolic fractions from rat, mouse and pig were used. Following incubations of the biocolourants with the enzymes in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, UDP-glucuronic acid, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) or S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to enable CYP oxidation, glucuronidation, sulfonation or methylation, we observed several oxidation and conjugation metabolites for dermocybin but none for dermorubin. Human CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 and 3A7 catalysed dermocybin oxidation. The formation of dermocybin glucuronides was catalysed by human UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10 and 2B15. Human SULT1B1, 1C2 and 2A1 sulfonated dermocybin. Dermocybin oxidation was faster than conjugation in human liver microsomes. Species differences were seen in dermocybin glucuronidation between human, rat, mouse and pig.

Recent cryo-EM data suggested that Y361, E386, and R439, referred to as the YER motif, could be important for transport. Building on this, we used extensive functional analyses to investigate the general function, and the substrate-specific effects of the YER motif. We determined the activity of the Y361A, E386A, and R439A mutants for fifteen OCT1 substrates. Extended mutagenesis revealed the negative charge of E386 and the positive charge of R439 as essential for the transport of all substrates tested. Charge reversal mutants, E386R-R439E, did not restore transport activity, suggesting that at least one of the two amino acids is involved in additional interactions essential for transport. Y361 exhibited substrate-specific effects. The Y361A mutant transported fenoterol, but not pirbuterol or other beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic drugs with only one aromatic ring. MD simulations suggested that substrates with aromatic or lipophilic characteristics may compensate for the missing aromatic ring at position 361. Only tryptophan at codon 361 efficiently rescued the transport of the Y361A mutant supporting hydrogen bound interaction with E386 and R439. Our study confirms that the YER motif is essential for OCT1 transport and points to Y361 as a lever that interacts with E386 and R439 to trigger the closing of the binding pocket of human OCT1. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956342/ """,

The immune system recognizes the changes caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation; it produces antibodies and causes inflammation of the skin in the exposed areas (2). Common photoallergic drugs and ingredients are included in some sunscreens, aftershave lotions, antimicrobials (especially sulfonamides), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diuretics, anticonvulsants, chemotherapy drugs, fragrances, and other hygiene products (1,3,4). A 64-year-old female patient was admitted to the Department of Dermatology and Venereology with erythema and underlining edema on her left foot (Figure 1). A few weeks earlier, the patient had had a fracture of the metatarsal bones and since then she had been taking NSAIDs systemically every day to suppress pain. Five days before being admitted to our Department, the patient started applying 2.5% ketoprofen gel to her left foot twice daily and was frequently exposed to the sun. For the last twenty years, the patient had been struggling with chronic back pain and was frequently taking different NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc.). The patient also suffered from essential hypertension and was regularly taking ramipril. She was advised to discontinue ketoprofen application, avoid sunlight, and apply betamethasone cream twice daily for 7 days, which lead to complete resolution of the skin lesions in a few weeks. Two months later, we performed patch and photopatch tests to baseline series and topical ketoprofen. Only the irradiated side of the body where ketoprofen-containing gel was applied showed positive reaction to ketoprofen. Photoallergic reactions manifest as eczematous, pruritic lesions, which may spread to involve other areas of the skin that were not previously exposed to the sun (4). Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug composed of a benzoylphenyl propionic acid that is commonly used both topically and systemically for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases because of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects and low toxicity, but it is one of the most frequent photoallergens (1,5,6). Ketoprofen-induced photosensitivity reactions usually present as photoallergic dermatitis characterized as acute dermatitis with edema, erythema, papulovesicles, blisters, or erythema exsudativum multiforme-like lesions at the application site 1 week to 1 month after the initiation of use (7). Depending on the frequency and intensity of sun exposure, ketoprofen photodermatitis may continue or reoccur up to 1 to 14 years after discontinuing the medication (6,8). Moreover, ketoprofen contaminates clothing, shoes, and bandages, and some cases of photoallergy relapses have been reported that were induced by ketoprofen-contaminated objects after they were used again in the presence of UV radiation (5,6). Due to their similar biochemical structure, patients with ketoprofen photoallergy should avoid using some drugs such as some NSAIDs (suprofen, tiaprofenic acid), antilipidemic agent (fenofibrate) and sunscreens based on benzophenones (6,9). Physicians and pharmacists should advise patients of the potential risks when topical NSAIDs are applied on the photoexposed skin. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36812283/ """,

""" 39949800: RESULTS: In our study, firstly, we identify 21 major bioactive components from Huachansu. CCK-8 assay results showed that Huachansu and its bioactive bufadienolides (Bufalin, Bufotalin, Cinobufotalin, Desacetylcinobufagin, Arenobufagin, Telocinobufagin, and Resibufogenin) significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and SK-HEP-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further molecular mechanistic investigation demonstrates that Huachansu significantly suppresses thymidylate synthase (TYMS), the enzyme which provides the sole de novo source of thymidylate for DNA synthesis. The inhibition of TYMS could lead to cell-cycle block and DNA damage of HCC cells. Furthermore, we identified that Huachansu markedly increased γ-H2AX expression, which indicated the presence of DNA damage. Moreover, we confirmed that transfection of cells with small interfering RNA specific to TYMS could increase the suppressive effects of Huachansu on the HCC cells proliferation. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that Huachansu treatment had no effect on the transcription level of TYMS. Furthermore, proteasomal inhibitor MG132 could block TYMS inhibition induced by Huachansu, and concomitant administration of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) with Huachansu could further suppress the protein level of TYMS, indicating that Huachansu promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of TYMS in liver cancer cells. More importantly, the bioactive bufadienolides of Huachansu such as Bufalin, Bufotalin, Cinobufotalin, Desacetylcinobufagin, Arenobufagin, Telocinobufagin, and Resibufogenin could also significantly restrain the protein level of TYMS, revealing the material basis of inhibition of TYMS exposed to Huachansu. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a TYMS inhibitor, we also evaluate the effects of the combined treatment of Huachansu with 5-FU, the results show that interactions between Huachansu and 5-FU are synergistic or antagonistic.

Type AB thymomas have the features of epithelial tumor cells of A and B thymomas. The diagnosis can be difficult because of the complex morphology. Some novel thymic epithelial markers have been reported in several preclinical studies, but they have not been applied to clinical practice.

""" 39956210: Although a number of microtubule-targeting agents have been used in tumour therapy, their resistance and drug toxicity pose clinical challenges. Microtubule destabilizing agents (MDAs) targeting the colchicine site were found to have the advantage of being able to overcome drug resistance. In our previous studies, we identified a novel MDA from the compound database based on virtual screening methods. Its chemical formula is C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>19</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S, abbreviated as C10. In this study, molecular docking methods confirmed that the binding pattern of C10 to tubulin is similar to that of colchicine. Immunofluorescence staining and tubulin polymerization experiments showed that C10 disrupts the microtubule network and reduces the polymerization efficiency of tubulin. Cell proliferation and toxicity assay showed that C10 could effectively inhibit the growth of tumour cells. After 72 h treatment, the semi-inhibitory concentrations of A549, MCF-7 and HepG2 were 18.83 μM, 16.32 μM and 16.92 μM. Colony formation assay and EdU staining also showed that C10 significantly inhibited the proliferative capacity of tumour cells. Meanwhile, it was found by wound healing and transwell assay that the migration and invasive ability of tumour cells were relatively weakened after treatment with C10. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis and western blot revealed that C10 reduced the expression of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and upregulated the level of the Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), which in turn activated caspase-3 to promote apoptosis. Finally, the vivo studies in animal showed that C10 significantly inhibited the growth of tumour in nude mice without significant drug toxicity. Thus, C10 may be a colchicine binding site inhibitor with anticancer potential.

We have used high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision docking, and extra precise docking for extensive screening of Drug Bank compounds, and the uniqueness of this study is that it considers multiple protein targets of prognosis and metastasis of LC. The docking and MM\GBSA calculation scores for the Tiaprofenic acid (DB01600) against all ten proteins range from -8.422 to -5.727 kcal/mol and - 47.43 to -25.72 kcal/mol, respectively. Also, molecular fingerprinting helped us to understand the interaction pattern of Tiaprofenic acid among all the proteins. Further, we extended our analysis to the molecular dynamic simulation in a neutralised SPC water medium for 100 ns. We analysed the root mean square deviation, fluctuations, and simulative interactions among the protein, ligand, water molecules, and protein-ligand complexes. Most complexes have shown a deviation of <2 Å as cumulative understanding. Also, the fluctuations were lesser, and only a few residues showed the fluctuation with a huge web of interaction between the protein and ligand, providing an edge that supports that the protein and ligand complexes were stable. In the MTT-based Cell Viability Assay, Tiaprofenic Acid exhibited concentration-dependent anti-cancer efficacy against A549 lung cancer cells, significantly reducing viability at 100 μg/mL.

""" 39938666: Depression and anxiety disorders are often exacerbated by social stress, necessitating the exploration of molecular mechanisms underlying stress resilience. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a serine protease with pleiotropic effects in the brain, plays a critical role in modulating neuroplasticity and stress responses. This study investigates the behavioral and molecular effects of tPA gain-of-function in a social stress paradigm in male C57BL/6 mice using lentiviral vectors. Behaviorally, hippocampal tPA gain-of-function mitigated depression-like responses in the novelty-suppressed feeding, sucrose splash, tail suspension, and forced swim tests following exposure to chronic social stress. Additionally, in a two-bottle choice drinking paradigm, tPA overexpression reduced social stress-induced ethanol intake and preference, suggesting a role in dampening maladaptive coping behaviors. However, analysis of tastants' intake and preference revealed no significant effects of tPA overexpression, indicating that it does not influence hedonic responses under stress conditions. Molecularly, tPA overexpression preserved hippocampal tPA mRNA expression and maintained levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus despite chronic stress exposure. These findings highlight the potential neuroprotective effects of tPA in maintaining hippocampal plasticity and mitigating stress-induced dysregulation of critical neurotrophic pathways. Collectively, this study underscores the potential of tPA as a therapeutic target for stress-induced mood and substance use disorders by modulating behavioral and neurobiological responses to chronic social stress. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39938666/ """,

The polyol pathway aka aldose reductase (AR) pathway has gained significant association with diabetic retinopathy with regard to chronically enhanced glucose metabolism. Considerable research has been put forth to develop more effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the overwhelming challenges of vascular complications associated with diabetes. In this regard, constituents of Cichorium intybus can offer strong AR inhibitory potential because of their strong antidiabetic properties. Therefore, aim of this study was to investigate the AR inhibitory as well as antiglycation potential of C. intybus extract/compounds. The preliminary in vitro results showed that methanolic extract of C. intybus could significantly inhibit AR enzyme and advanced glycation end product formation. Eventually, based on previous studies and reviews, we selected one hundred fifteen C. intybus root constituents and screened them through Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET analysis. Later, after molecular docking analysis of eight compounds, five best were selected for molecular dynamics simulation to deduce their binding affinity with the AR enzyme. Finally, three out of five compounds were further tested in vitro for their AR inhibitory potential and antiglycation properties. Enzyme assay and kinetic studies showed that all the three tested compounds were having potent AR inhibitory properties, although to a lesser extent than ellagic acid and tolrestat. Similarly, kaempferol showed strong antiglycation property equivalent to ellagic acid, but greater than aminoguanidine. Intriguingly, significant reduction in sorbitol accumulation in RBCs by the tested compounds substantiated strong AR inhibition by these compounds. Moreover, decrease in sorbitol accumulation under high glucose environment also signifies the potential application of these compounds in diabetic retinopathy and other vascular complications. Thus, in sum, the in silico and in vitro studies combinedly showed that C. intybus root is a treasure for therapeutic compounds and can be explored further for drug development against diabetic retinopathy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39002911/ """,
