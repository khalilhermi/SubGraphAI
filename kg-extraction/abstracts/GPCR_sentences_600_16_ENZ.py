""" 39916318: In search of new putative antimicrobial drug targets in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, we aimed to identify and characterize retaining glycosidase activities in this bacterial pathogen. Using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), a panel of 7 fluorescent probes was screened to detect activities of diverse retaining glycosidase families. Based on this, a cocktail of 3 biotinylated probes (targeting α-glucosidases, β-galactosidases and α-fucosidases) was used for target enrichment and three glycoside hydrolase family proteins were identified by mass-spectrometry: 6-phospho-β-glucosidase (BglA), α-amylase family protein trehalase C (TreC), and autolysin (Atl). The physiological relevance of previously uncharacterized BglA and TreC was addressed in CRISPRi and inhibitor studies with the putative TreC inhibitor α-cyclophellitol-aziridine. Silencing of treC did not affect bacterial growth in rich media, but reduced biofilm formation in vitro, and attenuated virulence during Galleria mellonella infection, warranting future investigations into the biochemical function of this enzyme. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39916318/ """,

This study aims to investigate the association of dietary niacin intake with the prevalence of kidney stones among adults in the United States. The present cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2018. Dietary niacin intake was obtained from the first 24-h dietary recalls. The history of kidney stones was assessed by a questionnaire. Weighted logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS) and stratified analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between dietary niacin intake and the risk of kidney stones. A total of 28,508 participants were included. In the full adjusted model, an inverse relationship between dietary niacin intake and kidney stones was observed. Compared to individuals in the lowest dietary niacin intake group, those in the highest group had lower odds of developing kidney stones (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.63-0.97). RCS analysis showed a L-shaped relationship between niacin intake and kidney stones (P for non-linearity = 0.047). Stratified analysis indicated that this inverse associations appeared to be stronger among participants aged blew 60 years (P for interaction < 0.05). This cross-sectional study indicated that dietary niacin intake was associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones in US adults, especially in individuals under 60 years of age.

""" 39887931: Cancer cells cope with oxidative stress for their proliferation and metastasis by equipping antioxidant systems, among which the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) play crucial roles. However, whether PRDXs exhibit nonenzymatic functions remains unclear. Here, it is shown that the 1-cysteine PRDX (PRDX6) upregulates nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) to promote the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, independently of PRDX6's enzymatic activities. Mechanistically, PRDX6 interacts with NNMT to prevent its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite-motif protein 56 (TRIM56), leading to the inhibition of NNMT ubiquitination at lysine 23 and 210 and suppression of subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition, PRDX6-mediated NNMT upregulation activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, thereby promoting the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Notably, PRDX6 overexpression is associated with higher NNMT protein levels in human ovarian cancer tissues and is predictive of poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Overall, the findings illustrate a critical oncogenic mechanism of the antioxidant enzyme PRDX6 in promoting ovarian cancer progression beyond its enzymatic mechanisms. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39887931/ """,
""" 38759627: The yeast glucose-induced degradation-deficient (GID) E3 ubiquitin ligase forms a suite of complexes with interchangeable receptors that selectively recruit N-terminal degron motifs of metabolic enzyme substrates. The orthologous higher eukaryotic C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) E3 complex has been proposed to also recognize substrates through an alternative subunit, WDR26, which promotes the formation of supramolecular CTLH E3 assemblies. Here, we discover that human WDR26 binds the metabolic enzyme nicotinamide/nicotinic-acid-mononucleotide-adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) and mediates its CTLH E3-dependent ubiquitylation independently of canonical GID/CTLH E3-family substrate receptors. The CTLH subunit YPEL5 inhibits NMNAT1 ubiquitylation and cellular turnover by WDR26-CTLH E3, thereby affecting NMNAT1-mediated metabolic activation and cytotoxicity of the prodrug tiazofurin. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of NMNAT1- and YPEL5-bound WDR26-CTLH E3 complexes reveal an internal basic degron motif of NMNAT1 essential for targeting by WDR26-CTLH E3 and degron mimicry by YPEL5's N terminus antagonizing substrate binding.

Thanks to the advantage of no background fluorescence interference, the upconversion luminescence allows for reliable analysis of target molecules in complicated samples. Here, through screening of 20 natural amino acids, it is discovered that the photooxidation of methionine exhibited the fastest recovery rate of triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) luminescence via oxygen consumption, which is 400-fold faster compared to the well-known photooxidation of oleic acid. Furthermore, oxygen-resistant, small-size, red-to-blue TTA-UC nanoparticles with a record upconversion efficiency (7.2%, normalized to 100%) are prepared using hydrophobic butyl methionine as an oxygen scavenger. Surface negatively charged TTA-UC nanoparticles are able to selectively enrich positively charged paraquat on their surface.

Emerging biological evidence indicates a notable role for G-quadruplex (G4) DNA aggregation in neurodegenerative processes affecting neuronal cells, particularly in the presence of extended (G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> repeats in nuclear DNA sequences. Our study concerns d[(GGGGCC)<sub>3</sub>GGGG], a G4-forming DNA model featuring G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> repeats that is in correlation with neurodegeneration.

Because of their strong therapeutic activity and excellent safety profiles, azole antifungals are currently the most extensively used systemic antifungal drugs. Antibacterial properties of various topical antifungals, such as oxiconazole, which features oxime ether functionality, were discovered, indicating an exciting prospect in antimicrobial chemotherapy. Methods: In this study, eleven new oxime ether derivatives with the azole scaffold (5a-k) were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial effects using the microdilution method to obtain broad-spectrum hits. Results: Although the title compounds showed limited efficacy against Candida species, they proved highly effective against dermatophytes. Compounds 5c and 5h were the most potent derivatives against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Arthroderma quadrifidum, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values lower than those of the reference drug, griseofulvin. The MIC of 5c and 5h were 0.491 μg/mL and 0.619 μg/mL against T. mentagrophytes (MIC of griseofulvin: 2.52 μg/mL). The compounds were also tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Briefly, 5c was the most active against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, with MIC values much better than that of ciprofloxacin (MIC of 5c = 1.56 μg/mL and 1.23 μg/mL, MIC of ciprofloxacin = 31.49 and 125.99 μg/mL, respectively).

""" 31189651: Enhanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and diminished formation may promote bone loss. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (Phlpp1) regulates protein kinase C (PKC) and other proteins in the control of bone mass. Germline Phlpp1 deficiency reduces bone volume, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we found that conditional Phlpp1 deletion in murine osteoclasts increases their numbers, but also enhances bone mass. Despite elevating osteoclasts, Phlpp1 deficiency did not increase serum markers of bone resorption, but elevated serum markers of bone formation. These results suggest that Phlpp1 suppresses osteoclast formation and production of paracrine factors controlling osteoblast activity. Phlpp1 deficiency elevated osteoclast numbers and size in ex vivo osteoclastogenesis assays, accompanied by enhanced expression of proto-oncogene C-Fms (C-Fms) and hyper-responsiveness to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in bone marrow macrophages. Although Phlpp1 deficiency increased TRAP+ cell numbers, it suppressed actin-ring formation and bone resorption in these assays. We observed that Phlpp1 deficiency increases activity of PKCζ, a PKC isoform controlling cell polarity, and that addition of a PKCζ pseudosubstrate restores osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption of Phlpp1-deficient osteoclasts. Moreover, Phlpp1 deficiency increased expression of the bone-coupling factor collagen triple helix repeat-containing 1 (Cthrc1). Conditioned growth medium derived from Phlpp1-deficient osteoclasts enhanced mineralization of ex vivo osteoblast cultures, an effect that was abrogated by Cthrc1 knockdown. In summary, Phlpp1 critically regulates osteoclast numbers, and Phlpp1 deficiency enhances bone mass despite higher osteoclast numbers because it apparently disrupts PKCζ activity, cell polarity, and bone resorption and increases secretion of bone-forming Cthrc1. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31189651/ """,

The immunized mice were treated with daily intragastric PA or vehicle from day 1 to 14. The results showed that PA could aggravate EAU activities and increase the proportion of T helper (Th) 17 cells as well as mRNA expression level of Il17a. There were no significant changes in Th1/Treg cell responses between these two groups.

""" 39862447: Oocyte aging is closely related to a decline in female fertility, accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species levels and changes in protein posttranslational modifications. However, the role of protein palmitoylation in oocyte aging has not been investigated. In the present study, a new association between redox and palmitoylation in aging oocytes was found. We found that the protein level of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), a depalmitoylation enzyme, was increased in maternally aged mice oocytes and follicular fluid of aged (age >35 years) patients with decreased ovarian reserve (DOR). Elevated PPT1 led to decreased S-palmitoylation levels in oocytes, which impaired oocyte maturation and spindle formation. Tubulin was identified as a critical palmitoylated protein regulated by PPT1, whose palmitoylation was also decreased by advanced age, accompanied by abnormalities in membrane localization and microtubule polymerization. Melatonin was found to down-regulate excessive PPT1 and rescue PPT1-induced damage in mouse oocytes, not only by regulating oxidative stress, but also by binding with PPT1 to regulate its lysosomal degradation. In summary, our data demonstrate that PPT1 participates in oocyte aging by regulating tubulin palmitoylation, providing evidence that oxidative stress regulates protein palmitoylation and revealing a novel mechanism of oocyte aging. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39862447/ """,

""" 39479893: The bioaccessibility and bioavailability of dietary fatty acids depend on the lipid to which they are esterified, the organisation of theses lipids in water and their recognition by lipolytic enzymes. In this work, we studied the release of marine long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), depending on their presentation either in the form of phospholipids (PL) or triacylglycerol (TAG). Two formulations based on marine PL or TAG extracted from salmon heads (Salmo salar) were prepared. Lipolysis was first tested in vitro by using individual gastrointestinal lipases and phospholipases to identify the enzymes involved in the digestion. Second, the lipolysis of the prepared formulations by a combination of enzymes was tested under in vitro conditions mimicking the physiological conditions found in the GI tract, both in the stomach and in the upper small intestine, in order to evaluate digestibility of TAG and LC-PUFA-containing liposomes. The in vitro results showed that TAG emulsion was hydrolyzed by porcine pancreatic extracts (PPE) and pure pancreatic lipase (PPL) with its cofactor, colipase, and to a lesser extent by pancreatic-lipase-related protein 2 (PLRP2) and a gastric extract (RGE) containing gastric lipase while no hydrolysis was observed with purified pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and carboxyl ester hydrolase (CEH). The PL substrate was found to be hydrolysed by PLA2, PPE and PLRP2. Their phospholipase activities on liposomes formulation was dependent on the presence of bile salts. Using a two-step in vitro digestion model, we measured the kinetics of fatty acid release from TAG and PL during the gastric and intestinal phases of digestion. The highest overall lipolysis level was obtained with liposomes (around 75%) during the intestinal phase while they were preserved during the gastric phase. The overall lipolysis level of TAG emulsion was lower (around 33%), while it started already in the gastric phase. In conclusion, liposomes appear as a better delivery system for intestinal absorption of LC-PUFA than TAG. In addition, their resistance to lipolysis under gastric condition can protect LC-PUFA and provide a gastric stable delivery system for other molecules. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39479893/ """,

The redox reaction of His and Au(III) yields His oligomers with blue-green fluorescence and reducible Au(I) self-assemblies, which can form ultrasmall particles at electron bombardment. The resultant Au(I) complexes can be further reduced by d-penicillamine (DPA) via forming anisotropic Au nanoparticles with distinct local surface plasmon resonance absorption.

""" 39875173: BACKGROUND: Polyclonal autologous T cells that are epigenetically reprogrammed through mTOR inhibition and IFN-α polarization (RAPA-201) represent a novel approach to the adoptive T cell therapy of cancer. Ex vivo inhibition of mTOR results causes a shift towards T central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) whereas ex vivo IFN-α promotes type I cytokines, with each of these functions known to enhance the adoptive T cell therapy of cancer. Rapamycin-resistant T cells polarized for a type II cytokine phenotype were previously evaluated in the allogeneic transplantation context. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39875173/ """,
""" 39875173: METHODS: The clinical trial (NCT04176380) evaluated RAPA-201 therapy in combination with fludarabine-sparing low-dose host conditioning for the treatment of patients with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39875173/ """,
""" 39875173: RESULTS: From December 2020 to December 2022, 14 patients with RRMM received a median of three RAPA-201 infusions (median dose, 80×106 cells). RAPA-201 drug products (DPs) were: polyclonal; enriched for T<sub>CM</sub> cells; reduced for immune checkpoint expression, including PD1, CD73, and LAIR1; and preferentially secreted Th1 cytokines. The median chemotherapy dose administered per cycle was 1,817 mg total for cyclophosphamide (range, 1,100-2,200) and 2.35 mg/M2 for pentostatin (range, 0-16). Nine of 14 patients (64%) achieved disease remission, with eight partial responses and one stringent complete response. Median progression-free survival was 6.0 months (range, 2.1 to&gt;16.8 months). There were no toxicities of any grade attributable to RAPA-201, including no cytokine release syndrome and no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Only 4 of 14 patients (29%) had a serious adverse event (≥ grade 3) of any attribution. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39875173/ """,
""" 39875173: CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with our hypothesis, ex vivo manufacturing using mTOR inhibition and IFN-α polarization consistently yielded a novel RAPA-201 DP that possessed a desirable phenotype relative to cytokine phenotype, memory status, and checkpoint expression. RAPA-201 recipients had preservation of T cell counts and Th1 cytokine secretion yet had increased T cell receptor clonality that associates with antitumor responses in the setting of monoclonal antibody checkpoint therapy. RAPA-201 therapy overcomes previous barriers to effective autologous polyclonal T-cell therapy, as it is feasible to manufacture, exquisitely safe to administer, and mediates remission in patients with RRMM. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39875173/ """,
""" 39941644: Background: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pentoxifylline and tocopherol therapy in patients with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). Methods: During this study, 43 patients participated, including 21 women and 22 men with a mean age of 66.8 years, who showed 63 areas of osteitis altogether. The diagnosis was made based on X-ray imaging and histopathological findings. All the subjects received pharmacological treatment with pentoxifylline 400 mg and tocopherol 400 IU. The study scheme consisted of initial observation and two follow-up examinations every 5-6 months. MRONJ severity, peripheral blood parameters, and CRP levels were evaluated. The obtained results were statistically analyzed. Results: Complete remission occurred in 46% of the subjects, with a higher rate among those taking bisphosphonates intravenously compared to oral administration. The efficacy of pentoxifylline and tocopherol treatment was not influenced by gender or lesion location. Moreover, the worst response to treatment was observed in the group with the highest disease stage, as determined in the initial study. Conclusions: Pentoxifylline and tocopherol therapy in MRONJ was effective in patients taking oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, in patients with osteoporosis, and undergoing oncological treatment. This treatment approach allows surgery to be avoided or significantly reduced. The good response to pharmacotherapy observed in patients with early stages of MRONJ shows an urgent need to monitor the patients treated with bisphosphonates carefully to diagnose MRONJ at the initial phase. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39941644/ """,
""" 39929804: Targeting host proteins that are crucial for viral replication offers a promising antiviral strategy. We have designed and characterised antiviral PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) targeting the human protein cyclophilin A (CypA), a host cofactor for unrelated viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The PROTAC warheads are based on fully synthetic macrocycles derived from sanglifehrin A, which are structurally different from the classical Cyp inhibitor, cyclosporine A. Our Cyp-PROTACs decrease CypA levels in cell lines and primary human cells and have high specificity for CypA confirmed by proteomics experiments. Critically, CypA degradation facilitates improved antiviral activity against HIV-1 in primary human CD4+ T cells compared to the non-PROTAC parental inhibitor, at limiting inhibitor concentrations. Similarly, we observe antiviral activity against HCV replicon in a hepatoma cell line. We propose that CypA-targeting PROTACs inhibit viral replication potently and anticipate reduced evolution of viral resistance and broad efficacy against unrelated viruses. Furthermore, they provide powerful tools for probing cyclophilin biology. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39929804/ """,

We use these sequences to study AZD2811, which is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), in its pure dry state as well as in its corresponding drug delivery formulation consisting of drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs). Included in this study are also small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for therapeutic targeting of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (Ppib) mRNA. We demonstrate that 1H-19F CP MAS experiments performed on the new HFX probe represent a notable advantage over usually acquired direct-detected 19F experiments. The indirect 19F DNP enhancement ε<sub>on/off</sub>(19F) = 26 was obtained via 1H-19F CP for the pure API impregnated with DNP solution, with an overall 30-fold sensitivity gain compared to the direct-detected 19F experiment under similar conditions. DNP enhancement value of ε<sub>on/off</sub>(19F) = 42 was obtained via 1H-19F CP for the polymeric nanoparticle suspension and ε<sub>on/off</sub>(19F) ≈ 150 were obtained for two different siRNAs in frozen DNP solution. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39793183/ """,

""" 39423109: RESULTS: A total of 17 DEGs related to SA-AKI were obtained (|log fold change| > 0 and P < .05). KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the primary pathways linked to the elevated DEGs were glycogen breakdown, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, and T-cell receptor, TNF, and NF-κB signaling. The module and PPI network analysis of common DEGs revealed one cluster and four candidate genes, including OASL, TRRAP, FKBP1A, and BANF. ChEMBL database analysis identified 339 target genes for allyl isothiocyanate, and the intersection with upregulated DEGs related to SA-AKI injury yielded two co-expressed genes, FKBP1A and TRRAP. According to the findings of the qRT-PCR assay, the kidney tissues of the model cohort showed significantly higher expression levels of FKBP1A mRNA than the control cohort (P = .0142). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39423109/ """,

""" 14517332: Null-mutations of the Arabidopsis FKBP-like immunophilin TWISTED DWARF1 (TWD1) gene cause a pleiotropic phenotype characterized by reduction of cell elongation and disorientated growth of all plant organs. Heterologously expressed TWD1 does not exhibit cis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity and does not complement yeast FKBP12 mutants, suggesting that TWD1 acts indirectly via protein-protein interaction. Yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screens with TWD1 identified cDNA sequences that encode the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis multidrug-resistance-like ABC transporter AtPGP1. This interaction was verified in vitro. Mapping of protein interaction domains shows that AtPGP1 surprisingly binds to the N-terminus of TWD1 harboring the cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase-like domain and not to the tetratrico-peptide repeat domain, which has been shown to mediate protein-protein interaction. Unlike all other FKBPs, TWD1 is shown to be an integral membrane protein that colocalizes with its interacting partner AtPGP1 on the plasma membrane. TWD1 also interacts with AtPGP19 (AtMDR1), the closest homologue of AtPGP1. The single gene mutation twd1-1 and double atpgp1-1/atpgp19-1 (atmdr1-1) mutants exhibit similar phenotypes including epinastic growth, reduced inflorescence size, and reduced polar auxin transport, suggesting that a functional TWD1-AtPGP1/AtPGP19 complex is required for proper plant development. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14517332/ """,
""" 38048701: Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) are a diverse family of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-5) found in various plant species. Faba bean is an economically important crop known for its nutritional value and resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including drought. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the gene structure, phylogenetics, and expression patterns of TLP genes in faba bean, with a specific focus on their response to drought stress. A total of 10 TLP genes were identified and characterized from the faba bean transcriptome, which could be classified into four distinct groups based on their evolutionary relationships. Conserved cysteine residues and REDDD motifs, which are characteristic features of TLPs, were found in most of the identified VfTLP members, and these proteins were likely to reside in the cytoplasm. Two genes, VfTLP4-3 and VfTLP5, exhibited significant upregulation under drought conditions. Additionally, ectopically expressing VfTLP4-3 and VfTLP5 in tobacco leaves resulted in enhanced drought tolerance and increased peroxidase (POD) activity. Moreover, the protein VfTLP4-3 was hypothesized to interact with glycoside hydrolase family 18 (GH18), endochitinase, dehydrin, Barwin, and aldolase, all of which are implicated in chitin metabolism. Conversely, VfTLP5 was anticipated to associate with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 3, a molecule linked to the synthesis of proline. These findings suggest that these genes may play crucial roles in mediating the drought response in faba bean through the regulation of these metabolic pathways, and serve as a foundation for future genetic improvement strategies targeting enhanced drought resilience in this economically important crop. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38048701/ """,
