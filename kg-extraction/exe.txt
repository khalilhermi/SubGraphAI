""" Cannabis sativa L is a plant belonging to the Cannabaceae family known primarily for its recreational use due to the psychoactive properties of 9tetrahydrocannabinol THC Despite this several compounds belonging to the category of phytocannabinoids have shown in recent years a number of potentially promising therapeutic effects that have increased the interest in the pharmaceutical field towards this plant However the content of these compounds is very variable and influenced by different factors such as growing conditions and time of the year An indication of the status and age of Cannabis samples is provided by the content of CBN a minor phytocannabinoid and degradation product of other phytocannabinoids including THC In this research work an innovative solid state analytical approach has been developed to observe and evaluate the variations in the content of two phytocannabinoids CBN and CBD in Cannabisderived products over time In order to simulate the ageing of the Cannabis samples an artificially accelerated ageing procedure has been developed and optimised by using high temperatures The analyses were carried out using an innovative ATRFTIR method for solid state analysis enabling direct analysis of a solid sample without any pretreatment phase This study has allowed the development of an innovative analytical approach for the evaluation of the age and state of conservation of Cannabis samples and may be a useful tool both in the industrial pharmaceutical and forensic fields """,

""" RESULTS AdoTHC sexdependently impacts acquisition of cueguided instrumental reward seeking but has minimal effects on setshifting or probabilistic discounting in either sex When we challenged dopamine circuits acutely with amphetamine during probabilistic discounting we found reduced discounting of improbable reward options with AdoTHC rats being more sensitive to these effects than controls In contrast neither acute chemogenetic stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons nor pathwayspecific chemogenetic stimulation of their projection to mPFC impacted probabilistic discounting in control rats although stimulation of this cortical dopamine projection slightly disrupted choices in AdoTHC rats """,
