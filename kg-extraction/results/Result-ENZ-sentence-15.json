Reverse transcription quantitative PCR followed by immunoblotting analysis showed increased amounts of SAMe synthase at both RNA and protein levels, respectively, in C6/36 mosquito cells infected with ZIKV at day 1 post infection (p.i.). Increased levels of SAMe was noted upon ZIKV infection at day 1 p.i in mosquito cells. In addition, increased EZH2 histone methyl transferase-like gene transcripts and methylated histone (H3K27me3) levels were evident in mosquito cells upon ZIKV infection. Exogenous addition of SAMe to mosquito cells showed increased ZIKV loads and EZH2 histone methyl transferase-like gene transcript levels. Furthermore, treatment of mosquito cells with EZH2 inhibitor resulted in reduced histone methylation and ZIKV loads.

The majority of patients reported poor satisfaction. Both modalities did not demonstrate a significant clinical nor dermoscopic response.

Sequence analysis of MCCB cDNA revealed two overlapping transcripts, one containing the normal 73 bp of exon 11 including the missense mutation c.1054G-->A (p.G352R), the other with exon 11 replaced by a 64-bp sequence from intron 10 (cryptic exon 10a) that maintains the reading frame and is flanked by acceptable splice consensus sites.

Although pheochromocytomas associated with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors and hyper-interleukin-6emia (hyper-IL-6emia) have been reported, those associated with both diseases simultaneously have not been reported. In pheochromocytomas with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors and hyper-IL-6emia, the disease characteristics and relationship between each hormone and cytokine are unknown. Herein, we report a case of a 56-year-old woman with stroke whose computed tomography scans of the abdomen revealed a right adrenal tumor on systemic examination. Endocrinological examination revealed elevated plasma levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in the urine and elevated levels of plasma ACTH, serum cortisol, and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, leading to a diagnosis of right pheochromocytoma and associated ectopic ACTH-producing tumor. Furthermore, hyper-IL-6emia was detected as a key indicator of anemia due to inflammatory hematopoietic disorders. The patient's general condition improved with drug therapy, including 1,000 mg/d of metyrapone, 2 mg/h of phentolamine, 8 mg/d of doxazosin, and systemic management. Dexamethasone suppression tests demonstrated suppressed serum cortisol and IL-6 levels, and dexamethasone dose-dependently increased plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels. These findings indicate that excess glucocorticoids play a stimulatory role in catecholamine secretion and a concentration-suppressive role in serum IL-6 levels in pheochromocytomas associated with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors and hyper-IL-6emia. The presence of rare comorbidities should be considered if the clinical findings cannot be explained by the pathophysiology of a pheochromocytoma alone because pheochromocytomas can be associated with the production of other hormones and cytokines. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956584/",

The patient's general condition improved with drug therapy, including 1,000 mg/d of metyrapone, 2 mg/h of phentolamine, 8 mg/d of doxazosin, and systemic management. Dexamethasone suppression tests demonstrated suppressed serum cortisol and IL-6 levels, and dexamethasone dose-dependently increased plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels. These findings indicate that excess glucocorticoids play a stimulatory role in catecholamine secretion and a concentration-suppressive role in serum IL-6 levels in pheochromocytomas associated with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors and hyper-IL-6emia. The presence of rare comorbidities should be considered if the clinical findings cannot be explained by the pathophysiology of a pheochromocytoma alone because pheochromocytomas can be associated with the production of other hormones and cytokines. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956584/",

ATP (5 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally once daily, metyrosine (50 mg/kg) orally twice daily, and melatonin (10 mg/kg) orally once daily. Methylphenidate (10 mg/kg) was administered orally once daily for 1 h after ATP, metyrosine and melatonin. The protocol was repeated for 30 days. Subsequently, blood samples were taken from the tail veins of the animals to measure adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, troponin I (TP I) and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) levels; the animals were then euthanized and the heart tissues were extracted. Tissues were analyzed for malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (tGSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) and histopathologically.",

Dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone increased the PTV in a dose-dependent manner with half maximal effective concentrations of 75.7 nM, 87.0 nM, and 13.7 µM, respectively. After the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, no increase in PTV was observed after administering any of the three inotropic agents. While dobutamine and epinephrine activated β-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine used both the phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathway to promote the release of intracellular Ca2+. However, dobutamine primarily acted on the PKA pathway, having only a minor influence on the PLC pathway. The induced changes in PTV following milrinone administration required both the PKA and PLC pathway, although the PKA pathway was responsible for most of the induced changes. In conclusion, the common inotropic agents dobutamine, epinephrine, and milrinone increase murine PTV in a concentration-dependent manner and ultimately release Ca2+ from intracellular calcium stores, suggesting the function of changes in mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract.",

Recently, it has been discovered that oxidative stress is an important contributor to AF. Therefore, antioxidant therapies for AF have great potential for clinical applications. Methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid residue other than cysteine, is recognized as a functional redox switch, which could be rescued from the reversible oxidation of methionine sulfoxide by methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA). S-Methyl-L-cysteine (SMLC), a natural analogue of Met, which is abundantly found in garlic and cabbage, could substitute for Met oxidations and mediate MsrA to scavenge free radicals. However, whether SMLC alleviates AF is unclear. This study aims to clarify the effects of SMLC on AF and elucidate the underlying pharmacological and molecular mechanisms. In vivo, SMLC (70, 140 and 280 mg kg-1 day-1) was orally administered to mice for 4 weeks with angiotensin II (Ang II) by subcutaneous infusion using osmotic pumps to induce AF. Ang II significantly prompted high AF susceptibility and atrial remodeling characterized by oxidative stress, conductive dysfunction and fibrosis. SMLC played a remarkable protective role in Ang II-induced atrial remodeling dose-dependently. Moreover, RNA sequencing was performed on atrial tissues to identify the differentially expressed mRNA, which was to screen out MSRA, CAMK2 and MAPK signaling pathways. Western blots confirmed that Ang II-induced downregulation of MsrA and upregulation of oxidized CaMKII (ox-CaMKII) and p38 MAPK could be reversed in a concentration-dependent manner by SMLC. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, HL-1 cells (mouse atria-derived cardiomyocytes) treated with Ang II were used for an in vitro model. SMLC alleviated Ang II-induced cytotoxicity, mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress. Additionally, knockdown MsrA could attenuate the protective effects of SMLC, which were eliminated by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. In summary, the present study demonstrates that SMLC protects against atrial remodeling in AF by inhibiting oxidative stress through the mediation of the MsrA/p38 MAPK signaling pathway.",

Methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid residue other than cysteine, is recognized as a functional redox switch, which could be rescued from the reversible oxidation of methionine sulfoxide by methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA). S-Methyl-L-cysteine (SMLC), a natural analogue of Met, which is abundantly found in garlic and cabbage, could substitute for Met oxidations and mediate MsrA to scavenge free radicals. However, whether SMLC alleviates AF is unclear. This study aims to clarify the effects of SMLC on AF and elucidate the underlying pharmacological and molecular mechanisms. In vivo, SMLC (70, 140 and 280 mg kg-1 day-1) was orally administered to mice for 4 weeks with angiotensin II (Ang II) by subcutaneous infusion using osmotic pumps to induce AF. Ang II significantly prompted high AF susceptibility and atrial remodeling characterized by oxidative stress, conductive dysfunction and fibrosis. SMLC played a remarkable protective role in Ang II-induced atrial remodeling dose-dependently. Moreover, RNA sequencing was performed on atrial tissues to identify the differentially expressed mRNA, which was to screen out MSRA, CAMK2 and MAPK signaling pathways. Western blots confirmed that Ang II-induced downregulation of MsrA and upregulation of oxidized CaMKII (ox-CaMKII) and p38 MAPK could be reversed in a concentration-dependent manner by SMLC. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, HL-1 cells (mouse atria-derived cardiomyocytes) treated with Ang II were used for an in vitro model. SMLC alleviated Ang II-induced cytotoxicity, mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress. Additionally, knockdown MsrA could attenuate the protective effects of SMLC, which were eliminated by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. In summary, the present study demonstrates that SMLC protects against atrial remodeling in AF by inhibiting oxidative stress through the mediation of the MsrA/p38 MAPK signaling pathway.",

We developed a bioinformatic technique to construct an interactome network-based molecular pathways for genes of interest and quantify their activation levels using high-throughput gene expression data. This study is focused on the p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ kinases, examining their activation levels (PALs) based on transcriptomic data and their associations with survival and drug responsiveness across various cancer types. We analyzed 11,287 human tumor profiles from 31 cancer types and 53 datasets to assess patient survival and clinical response to 29 therapies. Activation of p38 pathways showed varying prognostic significance depending on the cancer type. In astrocytoma, glioblastoma, thymoma, renal, bladder, esophageal, colorectal, stomach cancers, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, p38 pathway activation correlated with poor survival. Conversely, it indicated better survival in the gender-associated tumors (HER2+, luminal A and B subtypes of breast cancer, prostate carcinoma), sarcomas, lung adenocarcinoma, and others. These trends are aligned with the response-to-therapy analysis. For instance, higher activation of the p38β and p38γ pathways was linked to positive responses to taxane and anthracycline therapies in breast cancer, while lower activation of the p38α and p38β pathways correlated with better responses to 5-fluorouracil-based treatments in colorectal cancer. However, associations with individual MAPK14, MAPK11, MAPK12, and MAPK13 gene expression levels were less robust. Hence, the p38 pathway activation levels could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes and personalizing treatment strategies, including use of the selective p38 MAPK inhibitors.",

The aim of this study was to investigate TGF-β1 signaling in primary and permanent mast cells to identify common and unique mechanisms. The TGF-β receptor repertoire is similar among mast cells, with high expression of type I and type II receptors and very low expression of type III receptors (Betaglycan and Endoglin).

Initially, TGF-β1 upregulates the transcription of mucosal mast cell effectors Mcpt1 and Mcpt2 in all analyzed mast cells. This upregulation is reduced in the presence of IL-3, which promotes proliferation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation reduces proliferation and mitigates the negative effect of IL-3 on Mcpt1 mRNA and protein expression in the immortalized mast cell line PMC-306 but not in bone marrow-derived mast cells.

            "source": "The purpose of this study was to examine how low-energy LED red light influences the early to middle stage of osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) via the ERK5 signaling pathway. METHODS: PDLSCs were extracted from periodontal membrane tissue using enzymatic digestion. At three time points of 7, 10, and 14 days after irradiation with 5J/cm2 LED red light, the expression levels of early to middle-stage osteogenic-related genes ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR(qRT-PCR) in both control and osteogenesis experimental groups. The addition of BIX02189 could block the ERK5 signaling pathway. Under irradiation with 5J/cm2 LED red light, the expression levels of the ERK5 gene, related proteins ERK5, p-ERK5, as well as early to middle-stage osteogenic-related genes ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot in the osteogenic medium group and the osteogenic medium + BIX02189 group. RESULTS: Both low-energy LED red light and osteogenic medium could induce osteogenesis and differentiation of PDLSCs, upregulating the expression of ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN genes in PDLSCs. Their combination also produced a synergistic effect. Moreover, the ERK5 signaling pathway participated in the promoting effect of LED red light on the early to middle-stage osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs, indicating a positive role of LED red light in this process. CONCLUSIONS: The ERK5 signaling pathway can mediate the promotion of early to middle-stage osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs by low-energy LED red light.",

            "source": "The purpose of this study was to examine how low-energy LED red light influences the early to middle stage of osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) via the ERK5 signaling pathway. METHODS: PDLSCs were extracted from periodontal membrane tissue using enzymatic digestion. At three time points of 7, 10, and 14 days after irradiation with 5J/cm2 LED red light, the expression levels of early to middle-stage osteogenic-related genes ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR(qRT-PCR) in both control and osteogenesis experimental groups. The addition of BIX02189 could block the ERK5 signaling pathway. Under irradiation with 5J/cm2 LED red light, the expression levels of the ERK5 gene, related proteins ERK5, p-ERK5, as well as early to middle-stage osteogenic-related genes ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot in the osteogenic medium group and the osteogenic medium + BIX02189 group. RESULTS: Both low-energy LED red light and osteogenic medium could induce osteogenesis and differentiation of PDLSCs, upregulating the expression of ALP, Col-1, BSP, and OPN genes in PDLSCs. Their combination also produced a synergistic effect. Moreover, the ERK5 signaling pathway participated in the promoting effect of LED red light on the early to middle-stage osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs, indicating a positive role of LED red light in this process. CONCLUSIONS: The ERK5 signaling pathway can mediate the promotion of early to middle-stage osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs by low-energy LED red light.",

FAA can be used as marker for rancidity. Pearl millet is considered as Nutri-cereal due to its rich nutrient profile. Low keeping quality of the flour due to rancidity is one of the major problems in pearl millet. Lipases are a group of enzymes that produces free fatty acids that ultimately leads to rancidity. Very few lipases have been identified and characterized from pearl millet. Here, we have identified 2039 transcripts of lipases from pooled samples (leaf, stem and developing grains) of pearl millet using de novo transcriptomic approach and predicted 05 full length lipase variants. Further, we cloned 02 lipase genes-monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL, acc. no. MZ590564) and triacylglycerol lipase (TAGL, acc. no. MZ590565) of 1.5 kb each from pearl millet cv. Pusa-1201. Conserved domain search analysis showed the presence of catalytic triad [GXSXG] near the active site which is signature domain of lipase family of proteins. MAGL showed maximum expression in PC-701 and TAGL in Pusa-1201 during mealy-ripe growth stage of endospermic tissue. Abundance of transcripts of both the lipases was observed in the harvested grains of PC-701. We observed negative correlation between the lipase activity and accumulation of antioxidants like total phenolic content (TPC), tannin, and total antioxidant potential (TAP). Free amino acid and reducing sugar were observed as potential markers for accessing the intensity/extent of rancidity in pearl millet flour. Thus, there is need to explore and characterize the lipase variants to connect the missing dots in rancidity pathway and to use it in genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach for the development of pearl millet lines free of off-odor and flour rancidity.",

            "source": "Histones are nuclear proteins that play a key role in chromatin assembly and regulation of gene expression by their ability to bind to DNA. Histones can also be released from cells owing to necrosis or extracellular trap release from neutrophils (NETs) and other immune cells. The presence of histones in the extracellular environment has implications for many pathologies, including diabetes mellitus, owing to the cytotoxic nature of these proteins, and their ability to promote inflammation. NETs also contain myeloperoxidase, a defensive enzyme that produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl), to kill pathogens, but also readily damages host proteins. In this study, we examined the reactivity of histones with and without HOCl modification, with a pancreatic β-cell model. Exposure of β-cells to histones resulted in a loss of metabolic activity and cell death by a combination of apoptosis and necrosis. This toxicity was increased on pretreatment of the β-cells with tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β. Histones upregulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes, including the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP. There was also evidence for alterations to the cellular redox environment and upregulation of antioxidant gene expression. However, downregulation of insulin-associated genes and insulin was observed. Interestingly, modification of the histones with HOCl reduced their toxicity and altered the patterns of gene expression observed, and a further decrease in the expression of insulin-associated genes was observed. These findings could be relevant to the development of Type 2 diabetes, where low-grade inflammation favours NET release, resulting in elevated histones in the circulation.",

However, its effects have not yet been studied in ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to assess the protective effects of LA in UC and investigate its potential mechanisms of action. Our findings indicated that LA effectively mitigated oxidative stress in mice with colitis by increasing the production of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), while reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (p<0.05 for all). In NCM460 cells, LA inhibited the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in ROS and preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that LA decreased the production of inflammatory markers (p<0.05). Additionally, LA upregulated intestinal mucosal proteins, contributing to mucosal barrier repair. Mechanistically, LA activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling pathway, increasing the expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) while inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation (p<0.05). Notably, the inhibition of Nrf2 reversed the protective effects of LA against colitis. Molecular docking analyses support a strong interaction between Nrf2 and LA.

A potential peptide, ADSCP2 (adipose-derived stem cell peptide 2, the peptide fragment of ALCAM protein), derived from adipose-derived stem cell-conditioned medium, has been identified as having the potential to mitigate hypertrophic scar formation by targeting pyruvate carboxylase. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Whether ADSCP2 attenuates hypertrophic scar fibrosis at the transcription level remains unclear. Consequently, this study sought to elucidate the potential mechanism associated with ADSCP2 by examining genome-wide transcriptional alterations and changes in chromatin accessibility in fibroblasts. This was achieved through the integrated analysis of assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In the ADSCP2 treatment group, ATAC-seq identified a total of 7,805 differential peaks associated with 3,176 genes. RNA-seq analysis revealed 345 upregulated and 399 downregulated transcripts in the same group. A combined Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of both downregulated genes and close-ACRs (accessible chromatin regions) genes within the ADSCP2 treatment group indicated regulation of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OXPHOS) by ADSCP2. The amalgamation of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data elucidates that two OXPHOS associated genes, namely COX6B1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1) and NDUFA1 (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) alpha subcomplex-1), demonstrate significant downregulation in the presence of ADSCP2. Further analysis using the integrative genomics viewer indicates that the promoter regions of both COX6B1 and NDUFA1 exhibit a higher degree of closure in the ADSCP2 treatment group. Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that ADSCP2 treatment resulted in a reduction of COX6B1 and NDUFA1 mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, cellular ATP and lactic acid concentrations were diminished in the ADSCP2-treated group. Collectively, these findings suggest potential avenues for future research into the therapeutic application of the peptide ADSCP2 in the treatment of hypertrophic scars.",

A potential peptide, ADSCP2 (adipose-derived stem cell peptide 2, the peptide fragment of ALCAM protein), derived from adipose-derived stem cell-conditioned medium, has been identified as having the potential to mitigate hypertrophic scar formation by targeting pyruvate carboxylase. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Whether ADSCP2 attenuates hypertrophic scar fibrosis at the transcription level remains unclear. Consequently, this study sought to elucidate the potential mechanism associated with ADSCP2 by examining genome-wide transcriptional alterations and changes in chromatin accessibility in fibroblasts. This was achieved through the integrated analysis of assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In the ADSCP2 treatment group, ATAC-seq identified a total of 7,805 differential peaks associated with 3,176 genes. RNA-seq analysis revealed 345 upregulated and 399 downregulated transcripts in the same group. A combined Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of both downregulated genes and close-ACRs (accessible chromatin regions) genes within the ADSCP2 treatment group indicated regulation of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OXPHOS) by ADSCP2. The amalgamation of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data elucidates that two OXPHOS associated genes, namely COX6B1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1) and NDUFA1 (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) alpha subcomplex-1), demonstrate significant downregulation in the presence of ADSCP2. Further analysis using the integrative genomics viewer indicates that the promoter regions of both COX6B1 and NDUFA1 exhibit a higher degree of closure in the ADSCP2 treatment group. Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that ADSCP2 treatment resulted in a reduction of COX6B1 and NDUFA1 mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, cellular ATP and lactic acid concentrations were diminished in the ADSCP2-treated group. Collectively, these findings suggest potential avenues for future research into the therapeutic application of the peptide ADSCP2 in the treatment of hypertrophic scars.",

Water acidified with 0.025 % TFA (pH 2.4) and Acetonitrile were used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The retention time for Natamycin and Voriconazole was 3.1 min and 8.4 min, respectively. The calibration curve was obtained from (0.031 μg/mL to 25 μg/mL), which showed good linearity with an R2 value of 0.9997 for Natamycin and 0.9997 for Voriconazole, respectively. The coefficients of variation of the inter and intra-day precision were within the limits.
