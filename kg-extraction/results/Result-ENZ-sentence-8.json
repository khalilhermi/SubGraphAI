Traditionally, oral or topical medications have been employed to facilitate healing, approaches that are not only costly but may also lead to adverse effects such as gastrointestinal damage. With advancements in electrophysiology, the significance of bioelectric activity in tissue repair has become increasingly prominent, thereby enhancing the focus on research into electroacupuncture (EA) for bone repair. EA, a synthesis of traditional acupuncture and electrical stimulation, can regulate pain by inhibiting the transmission of electrical signals, reducing the expression of ion channel proteins, and promoting the release of neurotransmitters at targeted sites. Moreover, EA has the capability to influence macrophage polarization and modulate inflammatory cytokines, aiding in bone repair. Additionally, EA has the potential to regulate cytokines such as Ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EphB4), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Erythropoietin (EPO), and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP-2), thus promoting angiogenesis and fracture healing.This paper explores the mechanisms by which EA facilitates bone healing and assesses its advantages and limitations in clinical applications. It offers a theoretical foundation for the safe, effective, and rational use of EA, presenting a novel approach for enhancing bone regeneration.",

A total of 441 patients were randomly assigned to receive either ARX788 (n = 221) or LC (n = 220). The median PFS was 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.8) months with ARX788 compared with 8.2 (95% CI, 6.9-8.7) months with LC, as per BICR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, p = 0.0006). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were 98.6% and 99.1% for ARX788 and LC, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 41.4% and 40.0%, respectively, the most common adverse events were blurred vision (12.3%), dry eye (9.1%), keratopathy (5.9%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD, 5.9%) with ARX788; hand-foot syndrome (18.1%) and hypokalemia (5.1%) with LC; all the hematological and gastrointestinal events of grade ≥3 with ARX788 were less than 3%. Six treatment-related deaths occurred, with three cases possibly related to ILD. ARX788 significantly improved PFS compared with LC in patients with HER2-positive ABC with a distinct toxicity profile, supporting it as a potential treatment option.",

We enrolled 27 adult patients with cardiovascular disease (64 ± 15 years) and 35 healthy volunteers (36.37 ± 12.29 years). We used a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method to measure 25(OH)D2/3 concentrations and their epimers. Plasma concentrations of 1α,25(OH)2D3 were determined by sensitive and quantitative enzyme immunoassay following intra- and inter-day validation. Vitamin D insufficiency was observed in approximately 52% of the patients and 37% of healthy volunteers. Comparable levels of 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 were seen in both groups. The observed levels of the epimeric form 3-epi-25(OH)D3 appeared approximately 1.7 times higher in healthy volunteers, accounting for 9% misclassified according to vitamin D status. Also, patients had lower concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3, and their 3-epi-25(OH)D2 levels were below the detection limit (2 ng/mL).

The purity of the synthesized molecules was confirmed by the HPLC purity analysis and was found in the range of 93%-100%. The inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>) against hCA I ranged from 0.75 nM to 1972 nM. The sulfonamides inhibited isoform hCA II significantly, with a K<sub>i</sub> ranging from 0.09 to 56 nM. Similarly, the inhibitory effects on hCA IX and XII were found with K<sub>i</sub> spanning from 27.8 to 2099 nM and 9.43 to 509 nM, respectively. Most of the synthesized compounds showed significant inhibition in comparison to standard drugs such as acetazolamide, ethoxzolamide, zonisamide, methazolamide, dorzolamide, and SLC-0111. Antioxidant activity was assessed using the DPPH assay, with compound 13 showing better antioxidant activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 54.8 µg/mL, as compared to the standard ascorbic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> 64.7 µg/mL). The molecular docking studies provided insights into the binding modes of these compounds. The in silico physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic/ADME, and toxicity properties evaluations confirmed favorable drug-likeness properties, complying with Lipinski's rule. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of these compounds for the treatment of retinal/cerebral edema, glaucoma, edema, epilepsy management, high-altitude sickness, and cancer.",

Through screening relevant CVD targets in the Gene Card database, we found that AhR appears to be linked to CVDs. Computer-aided drug screening and molecular docking techniques identified famciclovir as a potential AhR inhibitor. Further experiments demonstrated that famciclovir suppresses AhR expression and platelet activation in thrombin-stimulated platelets, significantly reducing mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress.

Moreover, famciclovir mitigates FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced carotid arterial thrombosis and cerebral thrombosis induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion.

Male Wistar rats were randomly grouped into five, and the kindling model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of PTZ 35 (mg/kg) every other day for 1 month. Aside from the control and PTZ groups, three groups received intraperitoneal injections of fenoprofen at doses of 10, 20, and 40 (mg/kg) before each PTZ injection. Rats were challenged with PTZ 70 (mg/kg) 1 week after kindling development. Then rats were subjected to deep anesthesia, and serum and brain samples were prepared. Oxidative stress (OS) markers (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) were measured in serum samples. Hippocampal tissue was used to investigate the relative expression of OS-related genes (nuclear factor [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1)) and histological studies. Seizure behavior was assessed based on Lüttjohann's score. In treated groups, the number of myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) duration decreased significantly, while myoclonic jerks and GTCS latency increased compared with the PTZ group. The biochemical evaluation revealed the antioxidative effects of fenoprofen. The decreased expression of Nrf2/HO-1 genes in the PTZ group was reversed after fenoprofen administration. The results of the histological study obtained from Nissl staining in the hippocampal tissue also confirmed the protective effect of fenoprofen. The anticonvulsant effects of fenoprofen seem to be through inhibition of OS-related markers, induction of protective effect in hippocampal tissue, and activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.",

This study explored the ameliorative effects and mechanisms of saponins from Panax japonicus(SPJ) on anxiety disorder in mice fed a high-fat diet(HFD). Fifty C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into normal control diet(NCD) group, HFD group, and low-and high-dose SPJ groups. At week 12, six mice from the HFD group were further divided into a control group(treated with DMSO) and an exogenous fibroblast growth factor 21(FGF21) group(administered rFGF21). The anxiety-like behavior of the mice was assessed using the open field test and elevated plus maze test. Hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining and oil red O staining were performed to observe pathological changes in the liver and adipose tissue. Glucose metabolism was evaluated through the glucose tolerance test(GTT) and insulin tolerance test(ITT). Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of FGF21 and its downstream-related proteins in the liver and cortex, along with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF), disks large homolog 4(DLG4), and synaptophysin(SYP) in the cortex. Real-time quantitative fluorescent PCR(qPCR) was used to detect the expression of FGF21 and its receptor genes in the liver and cortex. Immunofluorescence staining was employed to examine the expression of neuronal activator c-Fos, FGF21, and the FGF21 co-receptor β-klotho in the cerebral cortex. The results showed that SPJ significantly improved the frequency of activity in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and the central area of the open field in HFD mice, up-regulated the expression of BDNF, DLG4, and SYP, and effectively alleviated anxiety-like behaviors in HFD mice. Compared with the NCD group, HFD mice exhibited up-regulated expression of FGF21 in the liver and cerebral cortex, while the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1(FGFR1) and β-klotho was significantly down-regulated, suggesting that HFD mice exhibited FGF21 resistance. SPJ markedly up-regulated the β-klotho levels in HFD mice, reversing FGF21 resistance. Further comparison with exogenously administered FGF21 revealed that SPJ activates brain cortical regions in a consistent manner, and additionally, SPJ promotes the number and colocalization of c-Fos and β-klotho positive cells in the brain cortex. In summary, SPJ effectively alleviates anxiety-like behaviors in HFD mice. Its mechanism is associated with up-regulation of β-klotho expression in the brain, reversal of FGF21 resistance, and subsequent activation of neurons in the cerebral cortex and amygdala.",

Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of FGF21 and its downstream-related proteins in the liver and cortex, along with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF), disks large homolog 4(DLG4), and synaptophysin(SYP) in the cortex. Real-time quantitative fluorescent PCR(qPCR) was used to detect the expression of FGF21 and its receptor genes in the liver and cortex. Immunofluorescence staining was employed to examine the expression of neuronal activator c-Fos, FGF21, and the FGF21 co-receptor β-klotho in the cerebral cortex. The results showed that SPJ significantly improved the frequency of activity in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and the central area of the open field in HFD mice, up-regulated the expression of BDNF, DLG4, and SYP, and effectively alleviated anxiety-like behaviors in HFD mice. Compared with the NCD group, HFD mice exhibited up-regulated expression of FGF21 in the liver and cerebral cortex, while the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1(FGFR1) and β-klotho was significantly down-regulated, suggesting that HFD mice exhibited FGF21 resistance. SPJ markedly up-regulated the β-klotho levels in HFD mice, reversing FGF21 resistance. Further comparison with exogenously administered FGF21 revealed that SPJ activates brain cortical regions in a consistent manner, and additionally, SPJ promotes the number and colocalization of c-Fos and β-klotho positive cells in the brain cortex. In summary, SPJ effectively alleviates anxiety-like behaviors in HFD mice. Its mechanism is associated with up-regulation of β-klotho expression in the brain, reversal of FGF21 resistance, and subsequent activation of neurons in the cerebral cortex and amygdala.",

Immunofluorescence staining was employed to examine the expression of neuronal activator c-Fos, FGF21, and the FGF21 co-receptor β-klotho in the cerebral cortex. The results showed that SPJ significantly improved the frequency of activity in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and the central area of the open field in HFD mice, up-regulated the expression of BDNF, DLG4, and SYP, and effectively alleviated anxiety-like behaviors in HFD mice. Compared with the NCD group, HFD mice exhibited up-regulated expression of FGF21 in the liver and cerebral cortex, while the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1(FGFR1) and β-klotho was significantly down-regulated, suggesting that HFD mice exhibited FGF21 resistance. SPJ markedly up-regulated the β-klotho levels in HFD mice, reversing FGF21 resistance. Further comparison with exogenously administered FGF21 revealed that SPJ activates brain cortical regions in a consistent manner, and additionally, SPJ promotes the number and colocalization of c-Fos and β-klotho positive cells in the brain cortex. In summary, SPJ effectively alleviates anxiety-like behaviors in HFD mice. Its mechanism is associated with up-regulation of β-klotho expression in the brain, reversal of FGF21 resistance, and subsequent activation of neurons in the cerebral cortex and amygdala.",

Here, we report that expression of C. elegans fmo-4 promotes lifespan extension and paraquat stress resistance downstream of both dietary restriction and inhibition of mTOR.

Further analysis supports a pathway where fmo-4 modulates calcium homeostasis downstream of activating transcription factor-6 (atf-6), whose knockdown induces and requires fmo-4 expression. Together, our data identify fmo-4 as a longevity-promoting gene whose actions interact with known longevity pathways and calcium homeostasis.",

Previous work supports that C. elegans fmo-2 promotes longevity, stress resistance, and healthspan by rewiring endogenous metabolism. However, there are five C. elegans FMOs and five mammalian FMOs, and it is not known whether promoting longevity and health benefits is a conserved role of this gene family. Here, we report that expression of C. elegans fmo-4 promotes lifespan extension and paraquat stress resistance downstream of both dietary restriction and inhibition of mTOR. We find that overexpression of fmo-4 in just the hypodermis is sufficient for these benefits, and that this expression significantly modifies the transcriptome. By analyzing changes in gene expression, we find that genes related to calcium signaling are significantly altered downstream of fmo-4 expression.

It was found that Cedazuridine (CDZ) could effectively inhibit the deamination of the drug by CDA, and its combination with GEM might affect the oral bioavailability of GEM. To investigate the effect of CDZ on the bioavailability and metabolism of GEM after oral administration, an HPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of CDZ, GEM, and its metabolite dFdU in mouse plasma. The separation of CDZ, GEM and dFdU was performed on an acetonitrile and water containing 0.1 % formic acid in isocratic elution on a COSMOSIL® 5C18-PAQ packed column (150 × 4.6 mm, 2.6 µm). The three analytes and the internal standard were determined in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode under positive ion conditions. The three analytes showed good linearity in the range of 5-10,000 ng/mL, and all quality control samples showed good precision and accuracy. The method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of GEM with CDZ. The results showed that CDZ significantly improved the oral bioavailability of GEM by reducing the metabolism of CDA to GEM in mice, which will provide a reference for the combined application of GEM and CDZ in clinical therapy.",

The aims of this study were to develop aqueous micelle based formulations of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and fluocinonide (FLU), using D-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate, and to investigate corticosteroid delivery to the epithelium-lamina propria junction region - the anatomical target for OLP treatment - in comparison to that from marketed products. Total mucosal deposition of TA after application of Kenacort® A Orabase® (0.1 % TA) and micellar hydrogel (0.1 %) was 242.1 ± 68.5 and 5936.7 ± 1269.6 ng/cm2, respectively. For FLU, deposition after application of Novoter (0.05 % FLU) and micellar hydrogel (0.05 %) was 617.1 ± 126.5 and 2580.0 ± 285.5 ng/cm2, respectively. A buccal biodistribution study showed that application of micelle hydrogels under occlusion for 30 min delivered 117.0 ± 15.6 ng/cm2 and 225.6 ± 36.7 ng/cm2, of TA and FLU, respectively, to the epithelium-lamina propria junction region. In contrast, the amounts deposited after applying Kenacort® A Orabase® and Novoter, were < LOQ. The results demonstrated that TPGS-based micelles improved mucosal bioavailability of TA and FLU in the epithelium-lamina propria junction region and might serve to improve topical OLP therapy.",

Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ARX788 (1.5 mg/kg, IV, Q3W) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (LC: lapatinib 1250 mg QD; capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID, days 1-14, Q3W) and stratified by prior chemotherapy lines (0-1 versus >1) and visceral metastasis (yes versus no). The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). A total of 441 patients were randomly assigned to receive either ARX788 (n = 221) or LC (n = 220). The median PFS was 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.8) months with ARX788 compared with 8.2 (95% CI, 6.9-8.7) months with LC, as per BICR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, p = 0.0006). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were 98.6% and 99.1% for ARX788 and LC, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 41.4% and 40.0%, respectively, the most common adverse events were blurred vision (12.3%), dry eye (9.1%), keratopathy (5.9%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD, 5.9%) with ARX788; hand-foot syndrome (18.1%) and hypokalemia (5.1%) with LC; all the hematological and gastrointestinal events of grade ≥3 with ARX788 were less than 3%. Six treatment-related deaths occurred, with three cases possibly related to ILD. ARX788 significantly improved PFS compared with LC in patients with HER2-positive ABC with a distinct toxicity profile, supporting it as a potential treatment option.",

Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ARX788 (1.5 mg/kg, IV, Q3W) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (LC: lapatinib 1250 mg QD; capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID, days 1-14, Q3W) and stratified by prior chemotherapy lines (0-1 versus >1) and visceral metastasis (yes versus no). The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). A total of 441 patients were randomly assigned to receive either ARX788 (n = 221) or LC (n = 220). The median PFS was 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.8) months with ARX788 compared with 8.2 (95% CI, 6.9-8.7) months with LC, as per BICR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, p = 0.0006). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were 98.6% and 99.1% for ARX788 and LC, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 41.4% and 40.0%, respectively, the most common adverse events were blurred vision (12.3%), dry eye (9.1%), keratopathy (5.9%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD, 5.9%) with ARX788; hand-foot syndrome (18.1%) and hypokalemia (5.1%) with LC; all the hematological and gastrointestinal events of grade ≥3 with ARX788 were less than 3%. Six treatment-related deaths occurred, with three cases possibly related to ILD. ARX788 significantly improved PFS compared with LC in patients with HER2-positive ABC with a distinct toxicity profile, supporting it as a potential treatment option.",

There was no significant difference in BPS scores between the two groups at enrollment, and BPS scores in oxycodone group were significantly lower than those in flurbiprofen axetil group at 24 and 48 h of enrollment. The proportion of patients with BPS less than 5 points in the Oxycodone hydrochloride group was also significantly lower than that in the flurbiprofen axetil group. For patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score greater than 10, subgroup analysis showed that the mechanical ventilation time of oxycodone hydrochloride group was significantly lower than that of flurbiprofen axetil group with statistical significance, and the dosage of midazolam was significantly lower than that of flurbiprofen axetil group. The length of ICU stay was significantly lower than that of flurbiprofen axetil group. Oxycodone hydrochloride was more potent than flurbiprofen axetil for analgesia for patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.",

Nevertheless, stronger evidence is needed for the aforementioned strategies.",

            "source": "39048308: Folate-dependent one-carbon (C1) metabolism encompasses distinct cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways connected by an interchange among serine, glycine, and formate. In both the cytosol and mitochondria, folates exist as polyglutamates, with polyglutamylation catalyzed by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), including cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms. Serine is metabolized by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT)2 in the mitochondria and generates glycine and C1 units for cellular biosynthesis in the cytosol. AGF347 is a novel pyrrolo[3,2-day]pyrimidine antifolate that targets SHMT2 in the mitochondria and SHMT1 and de novo purine biosynthesis in the cytosol. FPGS is expressed in primary pancreatic cancer specimens, and FPGS levels correlate with in vitro efficacies of AGF347 toward human pancreatic cancer cells. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells with CRISPR knockout of FPGS were engineered to express doxycycline-inducible FPGS exclusively in the cytosol (cFPGS) or in both the cytosol and mitochondria (mFPGS). Folate and AGF347 accumulations increased in both the cytosol and mitochondria with increased mFPGS but were restricted to the cytosol with cFPGS. AGF347-Glu<sub>5</sub> inhibited SHMT2 ∼19-fold greater than AGF347 By metabolomics analysis, mFPGS stimulated the C1 flux from serine in the mitochondria and de novo purine and dTTP synthesis far greater than cFPGS. mFPGS enhanced in vitro inhibition of MIA PaCa-2 cell proliferation by AGF347 (∼30-fold) more than cFPGS (∼4.9-fold).

FPGS is expressed in primary pancreatic cancer specimens, and FPGS levels correlate with in vitro efficacies of AGF347 toward human pancreatic cancer cells. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells with CRISPR knockout of FPGS were engineered to express doxycycline-inducible FPGS exclusively in the cytosol (cFPGS) or in both the cytosol and mitochondria (mFPGS). Folate and AGF347 accumulations increased in both the cytosol and mitochondria with increased mFPGS but were restricted to the cytosol with cFPGS. AGF347-Glu<sub>5</sub> inhibited SHMT2 ∼19-fold greater than AGF347 By metabolomics analysis, mFPGS stimulated the C1 flux from serine in the mitochondria and de novo purine and dTTP synthesis far greater than cFPGS. mFPGS enhanced in vitro inhibition of MIA PaCa-2 cell proliferation by AGF347 (∼30-fold) more than cFPGS (∼4.9-fold). Similar results were seen with other pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine antifolates (AGF291, AGF320); however, elevated mFPGS adversely impacted inhibition by the nonclassical SHMT2/SHMT1 inhibitor SHIN1. These results suggest a critical role of mFPGS levels in determining antitumor efficacies of mitochondrial-targeted pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine antifolates for pancreatic cancer. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: AGF347 is a novel pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine antifolate that targets serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT)2 in the mitochondria and SHMT1 and de novo purine biosynthesis in the cytosol.

Viral infection is caused by the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2). Previous computational studies have identified repurposed small molecules that target the RBD, but very few have screened drugs in the RBD-hACE2 interface. When studies focus solely on the binding affinity between the drug and the RBD, they ignore the effect of hACE2, resulting in an incomplete analysis. We screened ACE inhibitors and previously identified SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors for binding to the RBD-hACE2 interface, and then conducted 500 ns of unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of fosinopril, fosinoprilat, lisinopril, emodin, diquafosol, and physcion bound to the interface to assess the binding characteristics of these ligands. Based on MM-GBSA analysis, all six ligands bind favorably in the interface and inhibit the RBD-hACE2 interaction. However, when we repeat our simulation by first binding the drug to the RBD before interacting with hACE2, we find that fosinopril, fosinoprilat, and lisinopril result in a strongly interacting trimeric complex (RBD-drug-hACE2). Hydrogen bonding and pairwise decomposition analyses further suggest that fosinopril is the best RBD inhibitor. However, when lisinopril is bound, it stabilizes the trimeric complex and, therefore, is not an ideal potential drug candidate. Overall, these results reveal important atomistic interactions critical to the binding of the RBD to hACE2 and highlight the significance of including all protein partners in the evaluation of a potential drug candidate.",

Based on MM-GBSA analysis, all six ligands bind favorably in the interface and inhibit the RBD-hACE2 interaction. However, when we repeat our simulation by first binding the drug to the RBD before interacting with hACE2, we find that fosinopril, fosinoprilat, and lisinopril result in a strongly interacting trimeric complex (RBD-drug-hACE2). Hydrogen bonding and pairwise decomposition analyses further suggest that fosinopril is the best RBD inhibitor. However, when lisinopril is bound, it stabilizes the trimeric complex and, therefore, is not an ideal potential drug candidate. Overall, these results reveal important atomistic interactions critical to the binding of the RBD to hACE2 and highlight the significance of including all protein partners in the evaluation of a potential drug candidate.",

            "source": "Hemophilia A, caused by a deficiency in factor VIII (F8), is a promising target for gene therapy. This study aims to enhance the efficacy of adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) vectors, specifically those encoding B-domain-deleted F8 (BDDF8), to treat the condition. We focused on improving therapeutic outcomes by strategically deleting amino acids at the furin cleavage site (RHQR), a modification that is crucial for increasing F8 expression and reducing capsid stress during vector packaging. Using computational modeling with AlphaFold2, combined with western blotting and in vivo clotting assays, we developed and tested several AAV8-BDDF8 variants in a hemophilia A mouse model. The AAV8-BDDF8-ΔRHQR10 variant, which includes a 10-amino acid deletion at the RHQR site, demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in F8 activity, with sustained expression and no hepatotoxicity. This variant also showed reduced capsid stress and enhanced protein expression. However, the observed decline in long-term efficacy highlights the ongoing challenges in AAV-F8 gene therapy, emphasizing the need for continuous improvements. Our findings offer valuable insights for refining AAV-mediated gene therapy in hemophilia A, showing that targeted molecular modifications can significantly enhance therapeutic performance while ensuring safety.",
