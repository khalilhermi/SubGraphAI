            "source": "The RyR1 calcium release channel is a key player in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the RYR1 gene are associated with congenital myopathies. Recently, a role of RyR1 in myotubes differentiation has been proposed and attributed to its calcium channel function, which nonetheless remains to be clearly demonstrated. In order to clarify RyR1 role in myogenesis, we have developed an in vitro model, the so-called RyR1-Rec myotubes, which are mouse primary myotubes with an inducible decrease in RyR1 protein amount and in RyR1-mediated calcium release. Using this model, we showed that the RyR1 protein decrease was responsible for an increase in both differentiation and fusion, from the RNA level to the morphological level, without affecting the myogenic factors MyoD and MyoG. Although an increase in mTOR pathway was observed in RyR1-Rec myotubes, it did not seem to be responsible for the role of RyR1 in myogenesis. Additionally, even if modulation of intracellular calcium level affected RyR1-Rec myotubes differentiation, we have shown that the role of RyR1 in myogenesis was independent of its calcium channel function. Therefore, our findings indicate that, besides its pivotal role as a calcium channel responsible for muscle contraction, RyR1 fulfills a calcium-independent inhibitor function of myogenesis.",

Additionally, even if modulation of intracellular calcium level affected RyR1-Rec myotubes differentiation, we have shown that the role of RyR1 in myogenesis was independent of its calcium channel function. Therefore, our findings indicate that, besides its pivotal role as a calcium channel responsible for muscle contraction, RyR1 fulfills a calcium-independent inhibitor function of myogenesis.",

Tranilast was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg three times daily. Over the short-term period (28 weeks), the primary endpoint of change ratio in the logarithm of brain natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 28 weeks was not significant in the full analysis set but was lower in the per set protocol compared with data from a previous beta-blocker treatment study. All 15 patients who completed the short-term treatment consented to be enrolled in long-term therapy for an additional 116 weeks. After all participants completed the long-term treatment, we analyzed all data. TRPV2 expression on the peripheral blood mononuclear cell surfaces decreased throughout the study period, confirming that the TRPV2 inhibitory effect of tranilast was maintained over time. Despite the presence of progressive disease, cardiac indices such as brain natriuretic peptide level, human atrial natriuretic peptide level, and fractional shortening, remained stable, and only brain natriuretic peptide levels at 144 weeks showed significant changes. The survival rate was 80.7%, and no cardiac deaths were reported.

Agents/circumstances to avoid: High fever, vagotonic agents, alpha-adrenergic agonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants; first-generation antihistamines (dimenhydrinate); cocaine; class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs (flecainide, propafenone) and class 1A agents (procainamide, disopyramide). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Identification of relatives at risk using EKG or (if the pathogenic variant in the family is known) molecular genetic testing enables use of preventive measures and avoidance of medications that can induce ventricular arrhythmias.",

Innate intestinal immunity, including macrophages, plays a significant role in the pathological development of UC. Using the CIBERSORT algorithm, we observed elevated levels of 22 types of immune cell infiltrates, as well as increased M1 and decreased M2 macrophages in UC compared to normal colonic mucosa. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules associated with macrophages and UC, resulting in the identification of 52 macrophage-related genes (MRGs) that were enriched in macrophages at single-cell resolution. Consensus clustering based on these 52 MRGs divided the integrated UC cohorts into three subtypes. Machine learning algorithms were used to identify ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), sodium- and chloride-dependent neutral and basic amino acid transporter B(0+) (SLC6A14), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) in the training set, and their diagnostic value was validated in independent validation sets. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) revealed the main biological effects, and that interleukin-17 was one of several signaling pathways enriched by the three genes. We also constructed a competitive endogenous RNA (CeRNA) network reflecting a potential posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism. Expression of diagnostic markers was validated in vivo and in biospecimens, and our immunohistochemistry (IHC) results confirmed that HMGCS2 gradually decreased during the transformation of UC to colorectal cancer. In conclusion, ENPP1, SLC6A14, and HMGCS2 are associated with macrophages and the progression of UC pathogenesis and have good diagnostic value for patients with UC.",

Innate intestinal immunity, including macrophages, plays a significant role in the pathological development of UC. Using the CIBERSORT algorithm, we observed elevated levels of 22 types of immune cell infiltrates, as well as increased M1 and decreased M2 macrophages in UC compared to normal colonic mucosa. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules associated with macrophages and UC, resulting in the identification of 52 macrophage-related genes (MRGs) that were enriched in macrophages at single-cell resolution. Consensus clustering based on these 52 MRGs divided the integrated UC cohorts into three subtypes. Machine learning algorithms were used to identify ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), sodium- and chloride-dependent neutral and basic amino acid transporter B(0+) (SLC6A14), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) in the training set, and their diagnostic value was validated in independent validation sets. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) revealed the main biological effects, and that interleukin-17 was one of several signaling pathways enriched by the three genes. We also constructed a competitive endogenous RNA (CeRNA) network reflecting a potential posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism. Expression of diagnostic markers was validated in vivo and in biospecimens, and our immunohistochemistry (IHC) results confirmed that HMGCS2 gradually decreased during the transformation of UC to colorectal cancer. In conclusion, ENPP1, SLC6A14, and HMGCS2 are associated with macrophages and the progression of UC pathogenesis and have good diagnostic value for patients with UC.",

However, the development of orally available catechol-based biomaterials has been hindered by significant pH variations and complex interactions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, we introduce a novel catechol-modified bile acid (CMBA), which is synthesized by anchoring the FDA-approved drug, ursodeoxycholic acid to the neurotransmitter dopamine. This modification could form a new apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor (ASBTi) due to the bile acid moiety. The computational analysis using the TRAnsient Pockets in Proteins (TRAPP) module, coupled with MD simulations, revealed that CMBA exhibits a strong binding affinity at residues 51-55 of ASBT with a low inhibitory constant (Ki) value. Notably, in slightly alkaline biological conditions, CMBA molecules self-assemble into carrier-free nanoparticles with an average size of 240.2 ± 44.2 nm, while maintaining their ability to bind with ASBT. When administered orally, CMBA accumulates in the ileum and liver over 24 h, exhibiting significant therapeutic effects on bile acid (BA) metabolism in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mouse model.

However, the development of orally available catechol-based biomaterials has been hindered by significant pH variations and complex interactions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, we introduce a novel catechol-modified bile acid (CMBA), which is synthesized by anchoring the FDA-approved drug, ursodeoxycholic acid to the neurotransmitter dopamine. This modification could form a new apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor (ASBTi) due to the bile acid moiety. The computational analysis using the TRAnsient Pockets in Proteins (TRAPP) module, coupled with MD simulations, revealed that CMBA exhibits a strong binding affinity at residues 51-55 of ASBT with a low inhibitory constant (Ki) value. Notably, in slightly alkaline biological conditions, CMBA molecules self-assemble into carrier-free nanoparticles with an average size of 240.2 ± 44.2 nm, while maintaining their ability to bind with ASBT. When administered orally, CMBA accumulates in the ileum and liver over 24 h, exhibiting significant therapeutic effects on bile acid (BA) metabolism in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mouse model.

LLB-04 was isolated from the leaves of hemiparasite Scurrula parasitica L. during the winter season. The biosurfactant was produced in a static batch culture of 120 h using Nutrient Broth (NB) medium and was extracted by a series of solvent systems. The BS was purified by solvent fractionation and preparative High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method, and then it was structurally characterized through various analytical methods. Its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities were tested against 0, to 18 h old topical and food-borne pathogens. Furthermore, the cellular aggregation and bacterial cell adhesion on polystyrene and urethral catheters were checked at the Biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC). The cell line toxicity of BS (0-1.568 mg/ml) was tested against the human embryonic lung tissue L-132 and human alveolar epithelial cancer cell line, and the in silico mode of action was studied using standard methods. From the spectroscopic studies of 96 h culture harvested BS revealed that Bacillus sp. LLB-04 (GenBank Accession No.: MF037706) produced the BS as iturin C3. The BS had broad-spectrum antimicrobial with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.1 to 1.6 mg/ml and an average biofilm inhibition concentration (BIC) of 0.8-1.6 mg/ml in 18 h old cells where biofilm formation was inhibited up to 46.4 times at 1.6 mg/ml concentration.

The present study elucidates the structure and antimicrobial efficacy of iturin C3 biosurfactant (BS) produced by the endophytic bacterium Bacillus sp. LLB-04. Bacillus sp. LLB-04 was isolated from the leaves of hemiparasite Scurrula parasitica L. during the winter season. The biosurfactant was produced in a static batch culture of 120 h using Nutrient Broth (NB) medium and was extracted by a series of solvent systems. The BS was purified by solvent fractionation and preparative High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method, and then it was structurally characterized through various analytical methods. Its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities were tested against 0, to 18 h old topical and food-borne pathogens. Furthermore, the cellular aggregation and bacterial cell adhesion on polystyrene and urethral catheters were checked at the Biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC). The cell line toxicity of BS (0-1.568 mg/ml) was tested against the human embryonic lung tissue L-132 and human alveolar epithelial cancer cell line, and the in silico mode of action was studied using standard methods. From the spectroscopic studies of 96 h culture harvested BS revealed that Bacillus sp. LLB-04 (GenBank Accession No.: MF037706) produced the BS as iturin C3. The BS had broad-spectrum antimicrobial with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.1 to 1.6 mg/ml and an average biofilm inhibition concentration (BIC) of 0.8-1.6 mg/ml in 18 h old cells where biofilm formation was inhibited up to 46.4 times at 1.6 mg/ml concentration. It could also destabilize 40-48 h old preformed biofilm and had a synergistic response with streptomycin (Bacillus subtilis MTCC 411, Escherichia coli MTCC 730), ciprofloxacin (B. subtilis MTCC 411, E. coli MTCC 730), and vancomycin (Staphylococcus epidermidis MTCC 3086, B. subtilis MTCC 411).

It mediates the uptake of hydrophilic organic cationic drugs in hepatocytes and thus determine their systemic concentrations. OCT1 has a broad spectrum of structurally diverse substrates like metformin, sumatriptan, trospium, and fenoterol. Recent cryo-EM data suggested that Y361, E386, and R439, referred to as the YER motif, could be important for transport. Building on this, we used extensive functional analyses to investigate the general function, and the substrate-specific effects of the YER motif. We determined the activity of the Y361A, E386A, and R439A mutants for fifteen OCT1 substrates. Extended mutagenesis revealed the negative charge of E386 and the positive charge of R439 as essential for the transport of all substrates tested. Charge reversal mutants, E386R-R439E, did not restore transport activity, suggesting that at least one of the two amino acids is involved in additional interactions essential for transport. Y361 exhibited substrate-specific effects. The Y361A mutant transported fenoterol, but not pirbuterol or other beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic drugs with only one aromatic ring. MD simulations suggested that substrates with aromatic or lipophilic characteristics may compensate for the missing aromatic ring at position 361. Only tryptophan at codon 361 efficiently rescued the transport of the Y361A mutant supporting hydrogen bound interaction with E386 and R439. Our study confirms that the YER motif is essential for OCT1 transport and points to Y361 as a lever that interacts with E386 and R439 to trigger the closing of the binding pocket of human OCT1.",

Adults aged 18-64 years with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin and isoniazid, who weighed at least 40 kg, had a positive sputum smear graded at least 1+, were HIV negative, and had no history of hypertension or other substantial comorbidities were admitted to hospital. In stage 1 (multiple-ascending dose phase 1b with an adaptive continual reassessment method), the starting dose of BTZ-043 was 250 mg, with planned dose increments of 250 mg up to 2000 mg, and cohorts of three participants were enrolled sequentially. In stage 2 (phase 2a dose-expansion stage), participants were randomly assigned (3:3:3:2) to receive one of three doses of oral BTZ-043 (decided after stage 1) or standard of care (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) using sealed opaque envelopes. The BTZ-043 groups also received oral dolutegravir (a third of participants) or a probe drug cocktail (caffeine [probe for CYP1A2], tolbutamide [CYP2C9], dextromethorphan [CYP2D6], midazolam [CYP3A4], and digoxin [P-glycoprotein]; two-thirds of participants). Study staff and participants were not masked, but laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was to assess the safety and tolerability of BTZ-43 over 14 days of dosing by evaluation of adverse events in the safety analysis population. Secondary outcomes were bactericidal activity, measured by time to positivity (TTP) and colony-forming unit (CFU) count; pharmacokinetics (stage 2; including the food effect on BTZ-043); and drug-drug interactions with CYP450 enzymes, P-glycoprotein, and dolutegravir.

The primary endpoint, change in morning home systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) from baseline to end of treatment was similar between the two groups (intergroup difference in least squares mean change [95% confidence interval]: -1.3 [-3.8, 1.3]/-0.2 [-1.6, 1.3] mmHg for ARB; -2.7 [-4.2, -1.2]/-0.8 [-1.7, 0.1] mmHg for CCB). The respective incidences of serum potassium levels <3.5 mEq/L and ≥5.5 mEq/L in the ARB subgroup were 3.4% and 4.2% for esaxerenone and 7.9% and 0% for trichlormethiazide; in the CCB subgroup, they were 2.8% and 0.6% for esaxerenone and 13.9% and 1.2% for trichlormethiazide, respectively. The incidence of uric acid level ≥7.0 mg/dL was numerically higher in the trichlormethiazide group than the esaxerenone group in both the ARB and CCB subgroups. The non-inferiority of esaxerenone to trichlormethiazide in lowering morning home BP was demonstrated regardless of whether the basal antihypertensive agent was an ARB or CCB.

Despite the fatality it could cause, no antiviral treatment is currently available to treat the disease. Hence, this study aimed to repurpose old drugs as novel DENV NS3 inhibitors. Ligand-based (L-B) and proteochemometric (PCM) prediction models were built using 62,354 bioactivity data to screen for potential NS3 inhibitors. Selected drugs were then subjected to the foci forming unit reduction assay (FFURA) and protease inhibition assay. Finally, molecular docking was performed to validate these results. The in silico studies revealed that both models performed well in the internal and external validations. However, the L-B model showed better accuracy in the external validation in terms of its sensitivity (0.671). In the in vitro validation, all drugs (zileuton, trimethadione, and linalool) were able to moderately inhibit the viral activities at the highest concentration tested. Zileuton showed comparable results with linalool when tested at 2 mM against the DENV NS3 protease, with a reduction of protease activity at 17.89 and 18.42%, respectively. Two new compounds were also proposed through the combination of the selected drugs, which are ziltri (zilueton + trimethadione) and zilool (zileuton + linalool). The molecular docking study confirms the in vitro observations where all drugs and proposed compounds were able to achieve binding affinity ≥ -4.1 kcal/mol, with ziltri showing the highest affinity at -7.7 kcal/mol, surpassing the control, panduratin A. The occupation of both S1 and S2 subpockets of NS2B-NS3 may be essential and a reason for the lower binding energy shown by the proposed compounds compared to the screened drugs.

In the in vitro validation, all drugs (zileuton, trimethadione, and linalool) were able to moderately inhibit the viral activities at the highest concentration tested. Zileuton showed comparable results with linalool when tested at 2 mM against the DENV NS3 protease, with a reduction of protease activity at 17.89 and 18.42%, respectively. Two new compounds were also proposed through the combination of the selected drugs, which are ziltri (zilueton + trimethadione) and zilool (zileuton + linalool). The molecular docking study confirms the in vitro observations where all drugs and proposed compounds were able to achieve binding affinity ≥ -4.1 kcal/mol, with ziltri showing the highest affinity at -7.7 kcal/mol, surpassing the control, panduratin A. The occupation of both S1 and S2 subpockets of NS2B-NS3 may be essential and a reason for the lower binding energy shown by the proposed compounds compared to the screened drugs. Based on the results, this study provided five potential new lead compounds (ziltri, zilool, zileuton, linalool, and trimethadione) for DENV that could be modified further.",

The occupation of both S1 and S2 subpockets of NS2B-NS3 may be essential and a reason for the lower binding energy shown by the proposed compounds compared to the screened drugs. Based on the results, this study provided five potential new lead compounds (ziltri, zilool, zileuton, linalool, and trimethadione) for DENV that could be modified further.",
