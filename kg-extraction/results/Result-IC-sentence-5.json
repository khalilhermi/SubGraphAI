As with many K<sub>2P</sub>s1,5,10-14 and other voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily members3,15,16, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) lipids modulate K<sub>2P</sub>13.1 (THIK-1)1,5,14,17 via a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we present cryo-electronmicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human K<sub>2P</sub>13.1 (THIK-1) and mutants in lipid nanodiscs and detergent. These reveal that, unlike other K<sub>2P</sub>s13,18-24, K<sub>2P</sub>13.1 (THIK-1) has a two-chamber aqueous inner cavity obstructed by a M4 transmembrane helix tyrosine (Tyr273, the flow restrictor). This hydrophilic barrier can be opened by an activatory mutation, S136P25, at natural break in the M2 transmembrane helix and by intrinsic channel dynamics.
