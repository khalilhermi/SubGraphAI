He was recently prescribed indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for headaches. However, his headaches were in the context of worsening hypertension that was treated with trandolapril. The use of indomethacin consequently worsened his underlying condition. On presentation to the emergency department, his blood pressure was 190/110 mmHg. Bloodwork including electrolytes, glucose, metabolic studies, renal and liver function were within normal limits; infectious workup including blood and urine cultures subsequently returned negative; and brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no acute process to explain his presentation. Indomethacin was discontinued and the patient's hypertension was treated with amlodipine. Both his confusion and underlying headaches resolved as his blood pressure normalized. The patient was diagnosed with hypertensive encephalopathy triggered by indomethacin. NSAID use can trigger blood pressure decompensation, especially in patients with underlying hypertension; this effect is particularly pronounced in patients treated with anti-hypertensive medications that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAS) system.

Histone lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A) demethylates the mono- and di-methyl groups of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3K9 and plays an essential role in NSC proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of Seclidemstat (SP-2577), a reversible KDM1A inhibitor, and tranylcypromine (TCP), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and recently known as an irreversible histone lysine demethylase 1A inhibitor, on NSCs.

SP-2577 and TCP enhanced the transcription of Gfap and reduced Tubb3 transcription. Furthermore, SP-2577 increased the transcription levels of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, while TCP induced the transcription level of fibroblast growth factor 2.

Additionally, triazolam does not impair psychomotor performance. In certain cases, longer-term use of BZs or BZRAs may be appropriate; however, this approach requires careful individual assessment of the benefits and risks. Non-nightly use of hypnotic medications may also be a viable option for patients who do not require nightly treatment. Low-dose sedating antidepressants may be considered for short-term insomnia management (off-label), while antipsychotics and antihistamines are not recommended for this purpose.

The primary endpoint, change in morning home systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) from baseline to end of treatment was similar between the two groups (intergroup difference in least squares mean change [95% confidence interval]: -1.3 [-3.8, 1.3]/-0.2 [-1.6, 1.3] mmHg for ARB; -2.7 [-4.2, -1.2]/-0.8 [-1.7, 0.1] mmHg for CCB). The respective incidences of serum potassium levels <3.5 mEq/L and ≥5.5 mEq/L in the ARB subgroup were 3.4% and 4.2% for esaxerenone and 7.9% and 0% for trichlormethiazide; in the CCB subgroup, they were 2.8% and 0.6% for esaxerenone and 13.9% and 1.2% for trichlormethiazide, respectively. The incidence of uric acid level ≥7.0 mg/dL was numerically higher in the trichlormethiazide group than the esaxerenone group in both the ARB and CCB subgroups. The non-inferiority of esaxerenone to trichlormethiazide in lowering morning home BP was demonstrated regardless of whether the basal antihypertensive agent was an ARB or CCB. Esaxerenone with a CCB showed superiority to trichlormethiazide in lowering SBP, without any new safety concerns. Serum potassium levels tended to be higher when esaxerenone was combined with an ARB than with a CCB, but this can be mitigated if administered according to the package insert. A subgroup analysis of the EXCITE-HT study according to basal antihypertensive agent demonstrated the non-inferiority of esaxerenone to trichlormethiazide in lowering morning home BP regardless irrespective of the basal antihypertensive agent. Esaxerenone with a CCB showed superiority to trichlormethiazide in lowering SBP, without any new safety concerns.",

In a study of 30 female recreational athletes with tibial BSIs, 10 experienced additional BSIs over a 1-year period, prompting investigation of systemic biomarkers of subsequent BSIs using aptamer-based proteomic technology. We hypothesized that early proteomic signatures could discriminate runners who experienced subsequent BSIs. 1,500 proteins related to metabolic, immune, and bone healing pathways were examined. Using supervised machine learning and genetic programming methods, we analyzed serum protein signatures over the 1-year monitoring period. Models were also created with clinical metrics, including standard-of-care blood analysis, bone density measures, and health histories. Protein signatures collected within three weeks of BSI diagnosis achieved the greatest separation by sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA), clustering single and recurrent BSI individuals with a mean accuracy of 96 ± 0.02%. Genetic programming models independently verified the presence of candidate biomarkers, including fumarylacetoacetase, osteopontin, and trypsin-2, which significantly outperformed clinical metrics. Time-course differential expression analysis highlighted 112 differentially expressed proteins in individuals with additional BSIs. Gene set enrichment analysis mapped these proteins to pathways indicating increased fibrin clot formation and decreased immune signaling in recurrent BSI individuals. These findings provide new insights into biomarkers and dysregulated protein pathways associated with recurrent BSI and may lead to new preventative or therapeutic intervention strategies.",

Here, we demonstrated that Bl. iuvenis YSG is highly efficient in reducing UVB-induced melanin production in melanocytes. Through differential metabolomics analysis, we identified the metabolites 5-hydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid and aconitic acid as Bl. iuvenis YSG-specific anti-melanogenic substances. Bl. iuvenis YSG potently inhibited melanogenesis by downregulating melanogenic enzymes and directly acting on tyrosinase active sites. Furthermore, B. longum inhibited ROS generation in keratinocytes through its metabolite glycolic acid, increasing the levels of elastin, collagen III and collagen XVII in fibroblasts. We demonstrated that Bl. iuvenis YSG-derived fermentation components not only reduced the number of sunburn cells in UV-irradiated reconstituted human epidermis but also ameliorated ECM damage and epidermal atrophy in ex vivo human epidermis. Our results suggest that mixed metabolites derived from Bl. iuvenis synergistically contribute to antiphotoaging effects, specifically through the production of specific organic acids. These findings revealed that Bl. iuvenis is a novel potential protective agent for photoaging and provided an in-depth study of the underlying mechanism.",

Through differential metabolomics analysis, we identified the metabolites 5-hydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid and aconitic acid as Bl. iuvenis YSG-specific anti-melanogenic substances. Bl. iuvenis YSG potently inhibited melanogenesis by downregulating melanogenic enzymes and directly acting on tyrosinase active sites. Furthermore, B. longum inhibited ROS generation in keratinocytes through its metabolite glycolic acid, increasing the levels of elastin, collagen III and collagen XVII in fibroblasts. We demonstrated that Bl. iuvenis YSG-derived fermentation components not only reduced the number of sunburn cells in UV-irradiated reconstituted human epidermis but also ameliorated ECM damage and epidermal atrophy in ex vivo human epidermis. Our results suggest that mixed metabolites derived from Bl. iuvenis synergistically contribute to antiphotoaging effects, specifically through the production of specific organic acids. These findings revealed that Bl. iuvenis is a novel potential protective agent for photoaging and provided an in-depth study of the underlying mechanism.",

Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT, EC 2.6.1.5) is one of the key enzymes in the phenolic acid metabolic pathway, and the biological function and regulatory mechanism of its family member SmTAT2 have not been reported in S. miltiorrhiza. Through a transgenic assay (Overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9), we demonstrated that SmTAT2 can positively regulate the accumulation of phenolic acid. By using molecular interaction (Yeast single hybrid, Dual-LUC and EMSA) and transgenic technologies, we demonstrated that SmNAC36 first activates the transcription of SmMYB18, and SmMYB18 subsequently activates the expression of the target gene SmTAT2 to promote phenolic acid biosynthesis. Moreover, SmNAC36 can directly activate the transcription of SmTAT2. The molecular mechanism underlying the induced synthesis and accumulation of phenolic acid in Salvia miltiorrhiza by NAC36-MYB18-TAT2 molecular model is revealed.

Emerging areas of drug development include cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies. However, cost, accessibility, toxicity, and the need for either prolonged or repeated hospitalization prevent universal application of these therapies. Given this area of unmet clinical need, we present this review article on Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) degraders in patients with CLL/SLL. We focus on their development as a drug class, the up-to-date clinical data available, as well as future directions. BTK protein degraders are a novel drug class with an alternate mechanism of action (MOA), compared to cBTKis and non-covalent BTKis (ncBTKis), causing ubiquitination of BTK, thereby leading to its degradation through the proteasome. Encouraging pre-clinical data show that this MOA allows BTK protein degraders to overcome common BTK mutations. We focus on four agents which are under investigation in B-cell malignancies in early clinical trials: BGB-16673, NX-2127, NX-5948, and AC676. Preliminary data suggest a comparable safety and toxicity profile between agents across this drug class with many patients on phase 1 trials deriving durable clinical benefit. Optimal sequencing of BTK degraders in the therapeutic landscape of CLL/SLL treatment is yet to be established. Further trials investigating these agents in combination with other targeted CLL agents may help to further understand their applicability. An effective, tolerable oral class of drugs would be invaluable in the treatment of patients with multiply relapsed CLL/SLL.",

We focus on their development as a drug class, the up-to-date clinical data available, as well as future directions. BTK protein degraders are a novel drug class with an alternate mechanism of action (MOA), compared to cBTKis and non-covalent BTKis (ncBTKis), causing ubiquitination of BTK, thereby leading to its degradation through the proteasome. Encouraging pre-clinical data show that this MOA allows BTK protein degraders to overcome common BTK mutations. We focus on four agents which are under investigation in B-cell malignancies in early clinical trials: BGB-16673, NX-2127, NX-5948, and AC676. Preliminary data suggest a comparable safety and toxicity profile between agents across this drug class with many patients on phase 1 trials deriving durable clinical benefit. Optimal sequencing of BTK degraders in the therapeutic landscape of CLL/SLL treatment is yet to be established. Further trials investigating these agents in combination with other targeted CLL agents may help to further understand their applicability. An effective, tolerable oral class of drugs would be invaluable in the treatment of patients with multiply relapsed CLL/SLL.",

Current therapeutic agents targeting c-Src are primarily small molecules binding to its kinase domain. However, drug resistance often reduces the effectiveness of these drugs. The SH3 domain of c-Src is a highly conserved functional region with a low propensity for developing drug resistance, whereas there are no existing anti-cancer drugs specifically binding to this domain. In this study, structure-based virtual screening and thermal shift experimental verification identified three molecules that showed potent binding affinity with SH3 domain of c-Src. Subsequent kinase activity assay validated the inhibitory activity of these compounds against c-Src, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 60.42 to 122.2 nM. Next, cell-level assays and preliminary study were conducted to further evaluate the efficacy of the identified active compounds.

To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying PM tumorigenesis remain largely unknown. Herein, we describe a 7-year-old girl with a myofibroblastic lesion with plexiform features arising in the right deltoid region. The tumor proved positive for SMA staining, in absence of desmin, CD34, S100, and EMA expression. RNAseq analysis revealed a novel in-frame SH3PXD2B::FER fusion gene. The FER gene encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase which is implicated in several biologically aggressive tumors, where it is overexpressed and associated with EGFR recycling and stabilization. In our case, immunohistochemical analysis revealed a strong positivity for EGFR indicating an upregulation of EGFR transcription that might correlate with the novel chimeric protein involving the FER kinase domain. To our knowledge, the SH3PXD2B::FER fusion has never been reported previously. Whether the current case represents an example of a plexiform myofibroblastic tumor or a distinct tumor entity remains to be determined.",

Consistently, PFOS decreased the phosphorylation of Syk and Lck, central tyrosine kinases in IgE/Ag-stimulated mast cell activation, along with their downstream signaling molecules (PLCγ1, AKT, and MAPKs), through the activation of tyrosine phosphatase Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1. Additionally, PFOS reduced the phosphorylation of FcεRI-associated tyrosine kinases Fyn and Lyn. Fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed reduced fluorine signals of PFOS upon interaction with the plasma membrane, suggesting that PFOS accumulates in plasma membranes and interferes with FcεRI signaling by acting upstream, close to the membrane.

By searching the potential target of PHN in the online database and liver cancer disease database, it was found that there is only one overlap gene, and DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) is abnormally expressed in liver cancer tissues. TOP2A overexpression and downregulated hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were then constructed in vitro, and it was examined whether PHN treatment induced ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating TOP2A's inhibition of Janus kinase 2/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway through phenotypic assay, western blot assay, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR assay and electron microscopy. The results showed that PHN could inhibit the expression of TOP2A protein and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in hepatoma cells. PHN could also downregulate glutathione peroxidase 4 by suppressing the expression of TOP2A protein. PHN impeded the activity of factor inhibiting hypoxia‑inducible factor 1 alpha, thereby augmenting the synthesis of iron‑dependent apoptosis‑related proteins including cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, long‑chain acyl‑CoA synthetase family member 4 and NADPH oxidase 1, thus facilitating an increase in Fe2+ concentration and accelerating oxidative harm within hepatocellular carcinoma cells, culminating in the induction of ferroptotic cell death in these liver malignancy cells.",

Immunosuppressive M2 macrophages (MΦs) in the TME facilitate escape from immune surveillance and promote tumor growth; therefore, TME-induced immunosuppression is a potent immunotherapeutic approach to treating cancer. Methods: Cancer cell-secreted proteins were detected by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were used to assess which proteins were involved in MΦs polarization and differentiation. The protein-protein interaction was characterized using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Cancer-secreted heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) protein was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MΦ polarization and tumor growth were assessed in vivo with subcutaneous LLC-GFP tumor models and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) knockout mice; in vitro assessments were conducted using TLR2 knockout and both LLC-GFP and LN227 lentiviral-mediated knockdown (KD) cells. Results: Cancer cells released a secreted form of Hsp70 that acted on MΦ TLR2 to upregulate Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MerTK) and induce MΦ M2 polarization. Hsp70 nAbs led to a reduction in CD14 expression by 75% in THP-1 cells in response to Gli36 EMD-CM. In addition, neutralizing TLR2 nAbs resulted in a 30% and 50% reduction in CD14 expression on THP-1 cells in response to MiaPaCa-2 and Gli36 exosome/microparticle-depleted conditioned media (EMD-CMs), respectively. Hsp70, TLR2, and MerTK formed a protein complex. Tumor growth and intra-tumor M2 MΦs were significantly reduced upon cancer cell Hsp70 knockdown and in TLR2 knockout mice. Conclusions: Cancer-secreted Hsp70 interacts with TLR2, upregulates MerTK on MΦs, and induces immunosuppressive MΦ M2 polarization. This previously unreported action of secreted Hsp70 suggests that disrupting the Hsp70-TLR2-MerTK interaction could serve as a promising immunotherapeutic approach to mitigate TME immunosuppression in solid cancers.",

Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has so far only shown modest efficacy in ovarian cancer and platinum-based chemotherapy remains the front-line treatment. Development of platinum resistance is one of the most important factors contributing to ovarian cancer recurrence and mortality. Through kinome-wide synthetic lethal RNAi screening combined with unbiased datamining of cell line platinum response in CCLE and GDSC databases, here we report that Src-Related Kinase Lacking C-Terminal Regulatory Tyrosine And N-Terminal Myristylation Sites (SRMS), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is a novel negative regulator of MKK4-JNK signaling under platinum treatment and plays an important role in dictating platinum efficacy in ovarian cancer. Suppressing SRMS specifically sensitizes p53-deficient ovarian cancer cells to platinum in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SRMS serves as a sensor for platinum-induced ROS. Platinum treatment-induced ROS activates SRMS, which inhibits MKK4 kinase activity by directly phosphorylating MKK4 at Y269 and Y307, and consequently attenuates MKK4-JNK activation. Suppressing SRMS leads to enhanced MKK4-JNK-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting MCL1 transcription, thereby boosting platinum efficacy. Importantly, through a drug repurposing strategy, we uncovered that PLX4720, a small molecular selective inhibitor of B-RafV600E, is a novel SRMS inhibitor that can potently boost platinum efficacy in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, targeting SRMS with PLX4720 holds the promise to improve the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy and overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.",

Suppressing SRMS leads to enhanced MKK4-JNK-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting MCL1 transcription, thereby boosting platinum efficacy. Importantly, through a drug repurposing strategy, we uncovered that PLX4720, a small molecular selective inhibitor of B-RafV600E, is a novel SRMS inhibitor that can potently boost platinum efficacy in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, targeting SRMS with PLX4720 holds the promise to improve the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy and overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.",

The median PFS was 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.8) months with ARX788 compared with 8.2 (95% CI, 6.9-8.7) months with LC, as per BICR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, p = 0.0006). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were 98.6% and 99.1% for ARX788 and LC, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 41.4% and 40.0%, respectively, the most common adverse events were blurred vision (12.3%), dry eye (9.1%), keratopathy (5.9%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD, 5.9%) with ARX788; hand-foot syndrome (18.1%) and hypokalemia (5.1%) with LC; all the hematological and gastrointestinal events of grade ≥3 with ARX788 were less than 3%. Six treatment-related deaths occurred, with three cases possibly related to ILD.

One such mechanism is known as adaptive resistance, in which downstream signaling pathways are reactivated after initial inhibition. Past work has shown that FLT3/ITD cells undergo adaptive resistance through the reactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling within 24 h of sustained FLT3 inhibition. We investigated the mechanism(s) responsible for this ERK reactivation and hypothesized that targeting tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL), another receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in cancer resistance, may overcome the adaptive ERK reactivation. Experiments revealed that AXL is upregulated and activated in FLT3/ITD cell lines mere hours after commencing TKI treatment.

The effect of the treatments was assessed via phenotypic analyses that included germination percentage, speed, and seedling growth. Subsequently, the expression of the TDP1α and TDP1β genes was monitored through qRT-PCR. Results: Overall, the gathered data indicate that the atm mutant was highly sensitive to NSC120686, both phenotypically and concerning the TDP1α gene expression profiles. Alternatively, the upregulation of TDP1β in e2fb, pol2a, and atr supports its implication in the replication stress response.

We have previously generated a Caenorhabditis elegans model for type III galactosemia, which carries a hypomorphic mutation in the GALE gene homologue. In this model, we observed that the symptoms varied depending on the diet. The aim of this work is to identify which dietary metabolites might alleviate the symptoms of type III galactosemia. To identify the molecules responsible, we used a C. elegans model of type III galactosemia and a mouse model to test whether the respond to the treatment is conserved in mammals and thus could be a putative intervention in patients. We found that high levels of monosaccharides in the diet is responsible for the beneficial effect in the C. elegans model. This intervention generates an increase of gale-1 expression through activation of the insulin pathway which may explain the reduction of the symptoms in animals carrying hypomorphic mutations. The increase of the GALE gene expression after monosaccharides treatment is also conserved in mammals and if maintained in humans, monosaccharide treatment combined with monitorization of GALE expression could be included in the management of patients with type III galactosemia.",

Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling can be used to simulate untested scenarios and hence supplement clinical data to support dosing decisions. A PBPK model for the antiretroviral dolutegravir (mainly metabolized by UGT1A1) was verified using reported exposures in non-pregnant healthy volunteers, pregnant women, and the umbilical cord, lactating mothers, and breastfed neonates. The model was then applied to predict the impact of UGT1A1 phenotypes in extensive (EM), poor (PM), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM).
