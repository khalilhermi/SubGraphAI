The average nerve diameter was 28.14 ± 6.04 μm, with no significant difference between intratumoral (28.2 ± 7.65 μm) and extratumoral regions (27.86 ± 6.72 μm). PNI was observed in 65 patients (50.4%). PNI and high normalized nerve density (NND) were associated with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in CRC patients, with PNI identified as an independent prognostic factor. Patients with PNI exhibit higher NND. Incorporating PNI and NND into ROC curve analysis improved the sensitivity and specificity of survival predictions.",
