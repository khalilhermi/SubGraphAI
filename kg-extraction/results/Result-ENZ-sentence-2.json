In the present study, loquat fruit was immersed in oxygen concentrations of 70%, 80%, and 90% for 30 min before being stored at 4 ± 1 °C. The results showed that the 80% SHOP samples had lower lignin accumulation and firmness, showing reductions of 23.1% and 21.1% compared to the control at 50 days. These effects were associated with the inhibition of the activities of lignin synthesis-related enzymes, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), and peroxidase (POD).",
