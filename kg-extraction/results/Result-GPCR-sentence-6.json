In this study, we investigated NTDs and associated pathophysiological mechanisms in foetal rats following exposure to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). Out of 168 embryos from 15 pregnant rats in the experimental group, 78% displayed NTDs with notable spinal deformities, primarily in the lumbar-sacral region, similar to human cases. Body weight and crown-rump length (CRL) measurements indicated significant growth impairment in the NTD group compared to controls, while the atRA-treated group without NTDs showed no notable differences in growth. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results demonstrated decreased NeuN and PCNA expression in the NTD group's spinal cord. Oxidative stress markers showed markedly reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activity, alongside increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the NTD group, indicating heightened oxidative stress. Analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed elevated Bax and caspase-3 levels, reduced Bcl-2 and lower poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the NTD group, suggesting a pronounced shift towards proapoptotic pathways, potentially contributing to NTD progression. Our findings indicate that oxidative stress and apoptosis play significant roles in the development of NTDs.

In this study, we investigated NTDs and associated pathophysiological mechanisms in foetal rats following exposure to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). Out of 168 embryos from 15 pregnant rats in the experimental group, 78% displayed NTDs with notable spinal deformities, primarily in the lumbar-sacral region, similar to human cases. Body weight and crown-rump length (CRL) measurements indicated significant growth impairment in the NTD group compared to controls, while the atRA-treated group without NTDs showed no notable differences in growth. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results demonstrated decreased NeuN and PCNA expression in the NTD group's spinal cord. Oxidative stress markers showed markedly reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activity, alongside increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the NTD group, indicating heightened oxidative stress. Analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed elevated Bax and caspase-3 levels, reduced Bcl-2 and lower poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the NTD group, suggesting a pronounced shift towards proapoptotic pathways, potentially contributing to NTD progression. Our findings indicate that oxidative stress and apoptosis play significant roles in the development of NTDs. Future investigations should aim to pinpoint critical regulatory genes or proteins that might be targeted for therapeutic interventions to alleviate oxidative stress and apoptosis in NTD development.",

It mediates the uptake of hydrophilic organic cationic drugs in hepatocytes and thus determine their systemic concentrations. OCT1 has a broad spectrum of structurally diverse substrates like metformin, sumatriptan, trospium, and fenoterol. Recent cryo-EM data suggested that Y361, E386, and R439, referred to as the YER motif, could be important for transport. Building on this, we used extensive functional analyses to investigate the general function, and the substrate-specific effects of the YER motif. We determined the activity of the Y361A, E386A, and R439A mutants for fifteen OCT1 substrates. Extended mutagenesis revealed the negative charge of E386 and the positive charge of R439 as essential for the transport of all substrates tested. Charge reversal mutants, E386R-R439E, did not restore transport activity, suggesting that at least one of the two amino acids is involved in additional interactions essential for transport. Y361 exhibited substrate-specific effects. The Y361A mutant transported fenoterol, but not pirbuterol or other beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic drugs with only one aromatic ring. MD simulations suggested that substrates with aromatic or lipophilic characteristics may compensate for the missing aromatic ring at position 361. Only tryptophan at codon 361 efficiently rescued the transport of the Y361A mutant supporting hydrogen bound interaction with E386 and R439.

It mediates the uptake of hydrophilic organic cationic drugs in hepatocytes and thus determine their systemic concentrations. OCT1 has a broad spectrum of structurally diverse substrates like metformin, sumatriptan, trospium, and fenoterol. Recent cryo-EM data suggested that Y361, E386, and R439, referred to as the YER motif, could be important for transport. Building on this, we used extensive functional analyses to investigate the general function, and the substrate-specific effects of the YER motif. We determined the activity of the Y361A, E386A, and R439A mutants for fifteen OCT1 substrates. Extended mutagenesis revealed the negative charge of E386 and the positive charge of R439 as essential for the transport of all substrates tested. Charge reversal mutants, E386R-R439E, did not restore transport activity, suggesting that at least one of the two amino acids is involved in additional interactions essential for transport. Y361 exhibited substrate-specific effects. The Y361A mutant transported fenoterol, but not pirbuterol or other beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic drugs with only one aromatic ring. MD simulations suggested that substrates with aromatic or lipophilic characteristics may compensate for the missing aromatic ring at position 361. Only tryptophan at codon 361 efficiently rescued the transport of the Y361A mutant supporting hydrogen bound interaction with E386 and R439. Our study confirms that the YER motif is essential for OCT1 transport and points to Y361 as a lever that interacts with E386 and R439 to trigger the closing of the binding pocket of human OCT1. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956342/",

Lithium therapy was initiated to stabilize her mood and manage worsening psychiatric symptoms. However, while receiving treatment in the acute ward, she developed bradycardia with complete AV block, despite the absence of neurological symptoms or any reported discomfort. Elevated serum lithium levels strongly suggested lithium toxicity as the underlying cause. As lithium levels decreased, her heart rate normalized, and her sinus rhythm was restored. A review of her medication regimen identified the antihypertensive agent telmisartan as a potential contributor to lithium toxicity, which ultimately resulted in severe arrhythmia. Following her recovery, a detailed evaluation with a 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed no significant arrhythmias or pauses, further supporting the conclusion that the bradycardia was primarily due to the interaction between lithium and antihypertensive medications. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing atypical presentations of lithium toxicity, particularly cardiac manifestations, and highlights the potential for drug interactions with antihypertensive agents. Clinicians should maintain vigilance and ensure close monitoring when co-prescribing these medications to mitigate associated risks.",

In horses, this condition can increase the risk of life-threatening hyperthermia. A prior study has suggested that equine anhidrosis is associated with a missense variant (rs68643109) in the Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily E Regulatory Subunit 4 (KCNE4) gene. This project aimed to validate this association in a population of well-phenotyped horses and to determine the allele frequency of this variant in publicly available whole-genome sequence data. Fifty horses within the University of California Davis Center for Equine Health herd were evaluated for anhidrosis using a series of intradermal terbutaline injections. From existing whole-genome sequence data, the rs68643109 genotype of each horse was identified. When stimulated with terbutaline, all 50 horses produced sweat. All three genotypes at rs68643109 were present in this population of horses; the allele previously associated with anhidrosis (G) was present at a frequency of 0.72. No statistical difference in total sweat score was found (p = 0.31). In whole-genome sequences from 820 other horses reported across three prior studies, the alternative (candidate) allele frequency was similarly high, ranging from 0.52 to 0.68. Since all 50 horses tested in our population produced sweat regardless of genotype, and the previously associated allele is present at a high frequency across datasets, these data fail to validate the missense variant within the KCNE4 gene as causative of or contributing to equine anhidrosis. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39953936/",

            "source": "39875209: Fluoxetine (FLX), a typical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, has been frequently detected in aquatic environment and wild fish. However, little is known about its effect on thyroid endocrine system. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 1, 3, 10, and 30 μg/L of FLX for 6 days. Chemical analysis demonstrated that FLX and its metabolic product (nonfluoxetine, NFLX) were accumulated in zebrafish larvae. The exposure resulted in decreased thyroid hormones (THs) levels, indicating thyroid endocrine disruption. Moreover, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) content was significantly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure to FLX. Gene transcription in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis was further examined, and the results showed that the genes encoding corticotrophin-releasing hormone (crh) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) were significantly up-regulated as a compensatory mechanism for the decreased TH contents accompanied with decreased tshβ mRNA expression. In addition, genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis (sodium/iodide symporter, nis, thyroglobulin, tg) and transport (transthyretin, ttr) were down-regulated after exposure to FLX in a concentration-dependent manner. The increased gene transcription of deiodinases (dio2) and uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt1ab) might be responsible for the decrease of TH contents. In addition, a significant inhibition in thyroid hormone receptors (trα and trβ) gene expression was observed upon treatment with FLX. All these results demonstrated that FLX could alter THs and TSH content as well as gene transcription in the HPT axis, exerting an endocrine disruption of the thyroid system in zebrafish larvae.",

However, little is known about its effect on thyroid endocrine system. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 1, 3, 10, and 30 μg/L of FLX for 6 days. Chemical analysis demonstrated that FLX and its metabolic product (nonfluoxetine, NFLX) were accumulated in zebrafish larvae. The exposure resulted in decreased thyroid hormones (THs) levels, indicating thyroid endocrine disruption. Moreover, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) content was significantly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure to FLX. Gene transcription in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis was further examined, and the results showed that the genes encoding corticotrophin-releasing hormone (crh) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (trh) were significantly up-regulated as a compensatory mechanism for the decreased TH contents accompanied with decreased tshβ mRNA expression. In addition, genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis (sodium/iodide symporter, nis, thyroglobulin, tg) and transport (transthyretin, ttr) were down-regulated after exposure to FLX in a concentration-dependent manner. The increased gene transcription of deiodinases (dio2) and uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt1ab) might be responsible for the decrease of TH contents. In addition, a significant inhibition in thyroid hormone receptors (trα and trβ) gene expression was observed upon treatment with FLX. All these results demonstrated that FLX could alter THs and TSH content as well as gene transcription in the HPT axis, exerting an endocrine disruption of the thyroid system in zebrafish larvae.",

Objective: To summarize evidence supporting prostaglandin intracameral implants for treatment of ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from these treatments. Data sources: A PubMed search (1/1/2016 to 10/1/2024) was conducted to identify randomized, controlled clinical trials for bimatoprost 10-μg and travoprost 75-μg intracameral implants. Manufacturer prescribing information, formulary dossiers, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical reviews and glaucoma clinical treatment guidelines were also reviewed. Study selection and data extraction: English-language randomized controlled trials involving bimatoprost 10-μg or travoprost 75-μg intracameral implants were included. Data synthesis: Bimatoprost and travoprost intracameral implants demonstrated noninferior IOP reduction compared to timolol eye drops in phase 3 trials, with sustained effects up to 12 and 36 months, respectively. The FDA-approved implants are limited to a single administration to the affected eye to minimize corneal risks. The travoprost implant contains a titanium reservoir and requires surgical placement, while the bimatoprost implant is biodegradable and can be placed in a clinic setting.

            "source": "39911138: Background: Sustained-release prostaglandin intracameral implants are new targeted treatment options for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension that lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and reduce or eliminate the need for topical eye drops. Objective: To summarize evidence supporting prostaglandin intracameral implants for treatment of ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from these treatments. Data sources: A PubMed search (1/1/2016 to 10/1/2024) was conducted to identify randomized, controlled clinical trials for bimatoprost 10-μg and travoprost 75-μg intracameral implants. Manufacturer prescribing information, formulary dossiers, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical reviews and glaucoma clinical treatment guidelines were also reviewed. Study selection and data extraction: English-language randomized controlled trials involving bimatoprost 10-μg or travoprost 75-μg intracameral implants were included. Data synthesis: Bimatoprost and travoprost intracameral implants demonstrated noninferior IOP reduction compared to timolol eye drops in phase 3 trials, with sustained effects up to 12 and 36 months, respectively. The FDA-approved implants are limited to a single administration to the affected eye to minimize corneal risks. The travoprost implant contains a titanium reservoir and requires surgical placement, while the bimatoprost implant is biodegradable and can be placed in a clinic setting. There are no studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy of the two intracameral implants. Conclusions: Prostaglandin intracameral implants are a novel approach to reducing medication burden while delivering sustained IOP reducing effects. Pharmacists should be aware of efficacy and safety considerations of these implants relative to available topical treatments for ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39911138/",

Podocytes endocytosis is crucial for maintaining COL4 balance and GBM integrity. Previous studies have shown that G protein-coupled receptor 107 (GPR107) facilitates clathrin-dependent transferrin internalization and recycling in murine embryonic fibroblast cells. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the role of GPR107 in regulating COL4 balance within the podocytes ECM and its potential as a therapeutic target for DN. Here, we found a significant decrease in GPR107 expression in renal tissues from DN patients and streptozocin (STZ)-induced DN mice. Furthermore, GPR107-deficient mice with STZ-induced DN exhibited more severe kidney damage, marked by increased GBM thickening and COL4 accumulation. In vitro, GPR107 deficiency under high-glucose conditions promoted COL4 accumulation in the ECM of podocytes due to increased COL4 production and decreased COL4 degradation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GPR107 contributes to angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in podocytes. Therefore, GPR107 deficiency impairs AT1R internalization, leading to increased membrane-bound AT1R. This, in turn, activates the AT1R/Ca2+ signaling pathway to promote phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), ultimately enhancing COL4 synthesis and inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). These findings shed light on new functions of GPR107 in DN and offer new insights into a therapeutic target for DN.",
