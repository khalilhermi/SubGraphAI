The present study examined the anxiolytic properties of sesamol (SES), a phenolic lignan derived from Sesamum indicum, employing both in vivo and computational methods to understand its mechanisms of action. In this experiment, adult Swiss albino mice received various doses of SES (25 and 50 mg/kg, p.o.) orally. Afterward, a series of behavioral assessments, including open field, swing, hole cross, and light-dark testing, were conducted. The impact of the GABAergic agonist diazepam (DZP-1 mg/kg, i.p.) along with the antagonist flumazenil (FLU-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) has been studied as provided concurrently with the SES-50 group. Computational studies were performed to comprehend the interaction between SES and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits (α<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub>). The results of our investigation revealed that SES dose-dependently and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced the number of square crosses, hole crosses, swings, grooming, and rearing along with a reduction of light residence time in animals. When combined with DZP, SES-50 significantly reduced all these parameters, while altering with FLU-0.1. The molecular docking analysis showed that the SES has a relatively good binding score (-5.03 ± 0.15 and -5.25 ± 0.23 kcal/mol) with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> subunits, respectively. The SES triggers anxiolytic effects via GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> subunit interactions.

Ccnd1 binds to an intracellular loop in α4 and, together with Cdk4, phosphorylates the α4 subunit at threonine 423 and serine 431. These modifications upregulate α4 surface levels, increasing the response of α4-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, measured in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. In agreement with this role of Ccnd1-Cdk4 in neuronal signalling, inhibition of Cdk4 or expression of the non-phosphorylatable α4 decreases synaptic and extra-synaptic currents in the hippocampus of newborn rats. Moreover, according to α4 functions in synaptic pruning, CCND1 knockout mice display an altered pattern of dendritic spines that is rescued by the phosphomimetic α4. Overall, our findings molecularly link Ccnd1-Cdk4 to GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs activity in the central nervous system and highlight a novel role for this G<sub>1</sub> cyclin in neuronal signalling.",

These mutations reduce neither photolabeling within the intersubunit site nor competitive prevention of labeling by allopregnanolone.

Extensive experimental evidence indicates that the gustatory cortex (GC) is engaged in taste perception, palatability, and preference. However, our knowledge of the neural and neurochemical signals regulating taste preference is limited. Neuromodulators can affect preferences, though their effects on neural circuits for taste are incompletely understood. Neurosteroids are of particular interest, as systemic administration of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (ALLO), a positive allosteric modulator of extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing the delta subunit (δ-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), induces hyperphagia and increases intake of energy-rich food in humans and animals.

Here, we focused on GC to investigate whether activation of δ-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs affects sweet taste preference in adult mice. Our data reveal that δ-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are expressed in multiple cell types within GC, mediate an ALLO-sensitive tonic current, decrease the behavioral sensitivity to sucrose, and reduce the preference for sweet taste in a cell-type-specific manner.

Studies using animal models have shown that paternal cocaine use and highly motivated drug-seeking behavior are important determinants of offspring addiction susceptibility. However, the key molecules contributing to offspring addiction susceptibility are currently unclear. The motivation for cocaine-seeking behavior in offspring of male rats was compared between those whose fathers self-administered cocaine (SA) and those who were yoked with them and received non-contingent cocaine administrations (Yoke). We found that paternal experience with cocaine-seeking behavior, but not direct cocaine exposure, could lead to increased lever-pressing behavior in male F1 offspring. This effect was observed without significant changes to the dose-response relationship. The transcriptomes of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in offspring were analyzed under both naive state and after self-administration training. Specific transcriptomic changes in response to paternal cocaine-seeking experiences were found, which mainly affected biological processes such as synaptic connections and receptor signaling pathways. Through joint analysis of these candidate genes and parental drug-seeking motivation scores, we found that gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit gamma-3 (Gabrg3) was in the hub position of the drug-seeking motivation-related module network and highly correlated with parental drug-seeking motivation scores. The downregulation of Gabrg3 expression, caused by paternal motivational cocaine-seeking, mainly occurred in GABAergic neurons in the VTA. Furthermore, down-regulating GABAergic Gabrg3 in VTA resulted in an increase in cocaine-seeking behavior in the Yoke F1 group. This down-regulation also reduced transcriptome differences between the Yoke and SA groups, affecting processes related to synaptic formation and neurotransmitter transmission. Taken together, we propose that paternal cocaine-seeking behavior, rather than direct drug exposure, significantly influences offspring addiction susceptibility through the downregulation of Gabrg3 in GABAergic neurons of the VTA, highlighting the importance of understanding specific molecular pathways in the intergenerational inheritance of addiction vulnerability.",

Two functionally distinct GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes, the synaptic type α2β2γ2-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs versus extrasynaptic type α4β3δ-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were expressed in HEK293 cells alone or together with NL2 and co-cultured with striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons to enable innervation of HEK293 cells by GABAergic axons. When expressed alone, only the synaptic α2β2γ2-GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs induced innervation of HEK293 cells. However, when GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were co-expressed with NL2, the effect on synapse formation exceeded the individual effects of these proteins indicating a synergistic interaction, with α2β2γ2-GABA<sub>A</sub>R/NL2 showing a significantly greater synaptogenic activity than α4β3δ-GABA<sub>A</sub>R/NL2 or NL2 alone. To investigate the molecular basis of this interaction, different combinations of GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits and NL2 were co-expressed, and the degree of innervation and synaptic activity assessed, revealing a key role of the γ2 subunit. In biochemical assays, the interaction between NL2 and α2β2γ2-GABA<sub>A</sub>R was established and mapped to the large intracellular domain of the γ2 subunit. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39100896/",

In the present study, multi-electrode recordings were conducted on isolated mouse retina under full-field contrast stimulation.

This study investigated the long-term effects of human anti-GluA3 antibodies (anti-GluA3 hIgGs) on neuronal morphology and function using primary rat hippocampal neurons.

The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence intensity of brain slice was reduced in the presence of FCX. Notably, FCX significantly attenuated the spontaneous firing activity of SG neurons.

Allosteric modulators with selectivity for specific NMDA receptor subtypes are therefore attractive as therapeutic agents, and sustained drug discovery efforts have resulted in a wide range of new allosteric modulators. However, evaluation of allosteric NMDA receptor modulators is limited by the lack of operational ligand-receptor models to describe modulator binding dissociation constants (K<sub>B</sub>) and effects on agonist binding affinity (α) and efficacy (β). Here, we describe a pharmacological equilibrium model that encapsulates activation and modulation of NMDA receptors, and we apply this model to afford deeper understanding of GluN2A-selective negative allosteric modulators, TCN-201, MPX-004, and MPX-007. We exploit slow negative allosteric modulator unbinding to examine receptors at hemi-equilibrium when fully occupied by agonists and modulators to demonstrate that TCN-201 display weaker binding and negative modulation of glycine binding affinity (K<sub>B</sub> = 42 nM, α = 0.0032) compared with MPX-004 (K<sub>B</sub> = 9.3 nM, α = 0.0018) and MPX-007 (K<sub>B</sub> = 1.1 nM, α = 0.00053). MPX-004 increases agonist efficacy (β = 1.19), whereas TCN-201 (β = 0.76) and MPX-007 (β = 0.82) reduce agonist efficacy. These values describing allosteric modulation of diheteromeric GluN1/2A receptors with 2 modulator binding sites are unchanged in triheteromeric GluN1/2A/2B receptors with a single binding site. This evaluation of NMDA receptor modulation reveals differences between ligand analogs that shape their utility as pharmacological tool compounds and facilitates the design of new modulators with therapeutic potential. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Detailed understanding of allosteric N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulation requires pharmacological methods to quantify modulator binding affinity and the strengths of modulation of agonist binding and efficacy. We describe a generic ligand-receptor model for allosteric NMDA receptor modulation and use this model for the characterization of GluN2A-selective negative allosteric modulators. The model enables quantitative evaluation of a broad range of NMDA receptor modulators and provides opportunities to optimize these modulators by embellishing the interpretation of their structure-activity relationships.",

We exploit slow negative allosteric modulator unbinding to examine receptors at hemi-equilibrium when fully occupied by agonists and modulators to demonstrate that TCN-201 display weaker binding and negative modulation of glycine binding affinity (K<sub>B</sub> = 42 nM, α = 0.0032) compared with MPX-004 (K<sub>B</sub> = 9.3 nM, α = 0.0018) and MPX-007 (K<sub>B</sub> = 1.1 nM, α = 0.00053). MPX-004 increases agonist efficacy (β = 1.19), whereas TCN-201 (β = 0.76) and MPX-007 (β = 0.82) reduce agonist efficacy. These values describing allosteric modulation of diheteromeric GluN1/2A receptors with 2 modulator binding sites are unchanged in triheteromeric GluN1/2A/2B receptors with a single binding site. This evaluation of NMDA receptor modulation reveals differences between ligand analogs that shape their utility as pharmacological tool compounds and facilitates the design of new modulators with therapeutic potential. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Detailed understanding of allosteric N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulation requires pharmacological methods to quantify modulator binding affinity and the strengths of modulation of agonist binding and efficacy. We describe a generic ligand-receptor model for allosteric NMDA receptor modulation and use this model for the characterization of GluN2A-selective negative allosteric modulators. The model enables quantitative evaluation of a broad range of NMDA receptor modulators and provides opportunities to optimize these modulators by embellishing the interpretation of their structure-activity relationships.",

However, evaluation of allosteric NMDA receptor modulators is limited by the lack of operational ligand-receptor models to describe modulator binding dissociation constants (K<sub>B</sub>) and effects on agonist binding affinity (α) and efficacy (β). Here, we describe a pharmacological equilibrium model that encapsulates activation and modulation of NMDA receptors, and we apply this model to afford deeper understanding of GluN2A-selective negative allosteric modulators, TCN-201, MPX-004, and MPX-007. We exploit slow negative allosteric modulator unbinding to examine receptors at hemi-equilibrium when fully occupied by agonists and modulators to demonstrate that TCN-201 display weaker binding and negative modulation of glycine binding affinity (K<sub>B</sub> = 42 nM, α = 0.0032) compared with MPX-004 (K<sub>B</sub> = 9.3 nM, α = 0.0018) and MPX-007 (K<sub>B</sub> = 1.1 nM, α = 0.00053).

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are tetrameric ionotropic glutamate receptors that most often comprise two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. NMDARs generate functionally diverse synapses across neuron populations through cell-type-specific expression patterns of GluN2 subunits (GluN2A - 2D), which have vastly different functional properties and distinct downstream signaling. Diverse NMDAR function has also been observed at anatomically distinct inputs to a single neuron population. However, the mechanisms that generate input-specific NMDAR function remain unknown as few studies have investigated subcellular GluN2 subunit localization in native brain tissue. We investigated NMDAR synaptic localization in thalamocortical (TC) neurons expressing all four GluN2 subunits. Utilizing super resolution imaging and knockout-validated antibodies, we revealed subtype- and input-specific GluN2 localization at corticothalamic (CT) versus sensory inputs to TC neurons in 4-week-old male and female C57Bl/6J mice. GluN2B was the most abundant postsynaptic subunit across all glutamatergic synapses followed by GluN2A and GluN2C, and GluN2D was localized to the fewest synapses. GluN2B was preferentially localized to CT synapses over sensory synapses, while GluN2A and GluN2C were more abundant at sensory inputs compared to CT inputs. Furthermore, postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD95 and SAP102 were preferentially localized with specific GluN2 subunits, and SAP102 was more abundant at sensory synapses than PSD95.

            "source": "39396906: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant alterations in hippocampal function and structure, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the hippocampal region remain elusive. We integrated multiple transcriptome datasets including human or rat hippocampus (GSE173955, GSE129051, GSE84422) to identify candidate genes. Subsequent analyses including gene ontology analysis and protein-protein interaction mapping were performed to identify key genes and pathways. We found that glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA-type subunit 3A (GRIN3A) and glutamate metabotropic receptor 8 (GRM8), which are related to the glutamatergic system, were the top two annotated genes and directly related to MAPT, which encodes a tau protein. Since there is no direct evidence of interaction between tauopathy and these genes in AD, further transcriptomic data (GSE125957, GSE56772) from tau transgenic mice and experimental validations through primary rat hippocampal neurons and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain organoids were performed. Interestingly, we identified that decreased NR3A (encoded by GRIN3A) and mGluR8 (encoded by GRM8) are correlated with tauopathy and loss of postsynaptic function in AD. Taken together, our results identified a novel tauopathy biomarker GRIN3A in AD. Furthermore, our findings suggest that an integrated approach combining public databases and diverse experimental validations can contribute to the advancement of precision medicine therapies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39396906/",

In addition, Gene-Set Enrichment, Gene Ontology, and Reactome analyses confirm that inflammatory signature and immune system activation were present at T0 in both brain areas. Considering that inflammation is generally associated with depression and that no paradigms inducing the pathology were here applied, these SSRI pro-depressive effects should be considered in patients without a clear indication of depression. Moreover, DEGs related to neurotransmitters with a role in sexual behavior and the reward system, such as dopamine (e.g., sialyltransferase 8B-ST8SIA3), glutamate (e.g., glutamate receptor ionotropic delta-2-GRID2) and GABA (e.g., glutamate decarboxylase type 2-GAD2) or associated with neurexin and neuroligin pathways and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, were reported to be dysregulated in the NAc, further confirming dysfunction in this brain area. Interestingly, the analysis of DEGs altered at T1 in the NAc confirms the persistence of some of these side effects providing further information for post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) etiopathogenesis.",

Consequently, we investigated the effect of FCX on excitatory signaling mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), using the patch-clamp technique recorded from SG neurons of the Vc.

Specifically, the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-induced responses but not the kainic acid receptor (KAR)-mediated response were suppressed by FCX in standard extracellular solution. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of FCX on NMDA currents was repeatable and concentration-dependent. The FCX blockade of NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity was associated with the modulation of Ca2+ response without affecting Na+ ions. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence intensity of brain slice was reduced in the presence of FCX. Notably, FCX significantly attenuated the spontaneous firing activity of SG neurons. Altogether, these results reveal that FCX may protect SG neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity via primarily regulating Ca2+ response, thereby inhibiting the excitatory signaling induced by NMDA and AMPA receptors (AMPARs).",

Meanwhile, substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons of the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), a pivotal site in regulating orofacial nociceptive transmission via Aδ and C primary afferent fibers, majorly utilize glutamate as the principal excitatory neurotransmitter. Fucoxanthin (FCX), a carotenoid pigment extracted from brown seaweed, possesses various pharmaceutical properties including neuroprotective effect in multiple neuronal populations. To date, the direct activity of FCX on the SG of the Vc has not been extensively clarified. Consequently, we investigated the effect of FCX on excitatory signaling mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), using the patch-clamp technique recorded from SG neurons of the Vc. Here, FCX directly acted on glutamate receptors independent of voltage-gated sodium channel and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)<sub>A</sub>/glycine receptors in the voltage-clamp mode. Specifically, the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-induced responses but not the kainic acid receptor (KAR)-mediated response were suppressed by FCX in standard extracellular solution. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of FCX on NMDA currents was repeatable and concentration-dependent. The FCX blockade of NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity was associated with the modulation of Ca2+ response without affecting Na+ ions. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence intensity of brain slice was reduced in the presence of FCX. Notably, FCX significantly attenuated the spontaneous firing activity of SG neurons. Altogether, these results reveal that FCX may protect SG neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity via primarily regulating Ca2+ response, thereby inhibiting the excitatory signaling induced by NMDA and AMPA receptors (AMPARs).",

Consequently, we investigated the effect of FCX on excitatory signaling mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), using the patch-clamp technique recorded from SG neurons of the Vc.

Specifically, the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-induced responses but not the kainic acid receptor (KAR)-mediated response were suppressed by FCX in standard extracellular solution. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of FCX on NMDA currents was repeatable and concentration-dependent. The FCX blockade of NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity was associated with the modulation of Ca2+ response without affecting Na+ ions. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence intensity of brain slice was reduced in the presence of FCX. Notably, FCX significantly attenuated the spontaneous firing activity of SG neurons. Altogether, these results reveal that FCX may protect SG neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity via primarily regulating Ca2+ response, thereby inhibiting the excitatory signaling induced by NMDA and AMPA receptors (AMPARs).",

The FCX blockade of NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity was associated with the modulation of Ca2+ response without affecting Na+ ions. The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence intensity of brain slice was reduced in the presence of FCX. Notably, FCX significantly attenuated the spontaneous firing activity of SG neurons. Altogether, these results reveal that FCX may protect SG neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity via primarily regulating Ca2+ response, thereby inhibiting the excitatory signaling induced by NMDA and AMPA receptors (AMPARs).",

            "source": "39949835: Glutamate excitotoxicity is considered as the etiology of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and others. Meanwhile, substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons of the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), a pivotal site in regulating orofacial nociceptive transmission via Aδ and C primary afferent fibers, majorly utilize glutamate as the principal excitatory neurotransmitter. Fucoxanthin (FCX), a carotenoid pigment extracted from brown seaweed, possesses various pharmaceutical properties including neuroprotective effect in multiple neuronal populations. To date, the direct activity of FCX on the SG of the Vc has not been extensively clarified. Consequently, we investigated the effect of FCX on excitatory signaling mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), using the patch-clamp technique recorded from SG neurons of the Vc. Here, FCX directly acted on glutamate receptors independent of voltage-gated sodium channel and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)<sub>A</sub>/glycine receptors in the voltage-clamp mode. Specifically, the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-induced responses but not the kainic acid receptor (KAR)-mediated response were suppressed by FCX in standard extracellular solution.

Herein, we have investigated the mRNA expression of the glycine receptor alpha 1 (Glra1), alpha 2 (Glra2), alpha 4 (Glra4) and the beta (Glrb) subunits, in adult female and male mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing data re-analysis of the Zeisel et al. (2018) dataset indicated widespread expression of Glra1, Glra2 and Glrb in the CNS, while only a few cells in the cortex, striatum, thalamus, midbrain and the spinal cord expressed Glra4. Highest occurrence of Glra1, Glra2 and Glrb were found in the brainstem. Moreover, Glra1 and Glrb were revealed to have the highest occurrences in the spinal cord of the investigated subunits. However, both Glra2 and Glrb had a more widespread expression in the CNS compared with Glra1 and Glra4. Bulk quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed Glra1 expression in the hypothalamus, thalamus, brainstem and the spinal cord, and widespread, but low, Glra2 and Glrb expression in the CNS. Moreover, Glrb could be detected in a few visceral organs. Additionally, females and males were found to express Glra1, Glra2 and Glrb differently in certain brain areas such as the brainstem. Expression levels of Glra4 were too low to be detected using qRT-PCR. Lastly, RNAscope spatially validated the expression of Glra1, Glra2 and Glrb in the areas indicated by the single-cell and bulk analyses, and further revealed that Glra4 can be detected in the cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, brainstem, especially the cochlear nucleus, and in the spinal cord. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39580061/",

Recent studies have found that deep learning can effectively predict the biological activity of compounds by mining patterns and rules in the data, providing a potential solution for identifying drug side effects. In this study, we established a deep learning-based predictive model, utilizing a data set comprised of compounds known to either elevate or lower blood pressure. Subsequently, the trained model was used to predict the blood pressure-lowering effects of 26,000 compounds. Based on the predicted results, we randomly selected 50 molecules for validation and compared them with literature reports. The results showed that the predictions for 30 molecules were consistent with literature reports, with known antihypertensive drugs such as reserpine, guanethidine, and mecamylamine ranking at the top. We further selected 10 of these molecules and 3 related protein targets for molecular docking, and the docking results indirectly confirmed the model's accuracy. Ultimately, we discovered and validated that salaprinol significantly inhibits ACE1 activity and lowers canine blood pressure. In summary, we have established a highly accurate activity prediction model and confirmed its accuracy in predicting potential blood pressure-lowering compounds, which is expected to help patients avoid hypotensive side effects during clinical medication and also provide significant assistance in the discovery of antihypertensive drugs.",

A man in his 50s with a medical history of hypertension and chronic back pain presented with chest pain and hypertension.

Following medication administration, the patient was hypotensive.

Tizanidine was discontinued, and the hypotensive episodes resolved. Profound hypotension caused by a tizanidine-lisinopril drug interaction is rare but potentially life-threatening.

The prognosis-related genes were screened out and a risk model was constructed using univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and multivariate Cox analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the efficiency of model. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was applied for the survival analysis. Mutation analysis was conducted using maftools package. The effect of immunotherapy was analyzed according to TIDE score, and the drug sensitivity analysis was performed. The Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis enrichment analyses were performed for the functional analysis.

The regulatory network was constructed by STRING and Cytoscape software. RT-qPCR was performed to validate the expression of 3 hub genes in vitro. A risk model was constructed based on 3 ion channels related genes (gap junction protein beta 2 [GJB2], potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily h member 6 [KCNH6], and potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily n member 4 [KCNN4]). The risk score and hub genes were positively correlated with the calcium signaling pathway. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the risk score calculated by 3 signatures. The infiltration levels of T cell, B lineage, monocytic lineage, and neutrophils were increased in high risk group, while TIDE score was decreased. IC50 of potential drugs for GBM treatment was elevated in the high risk group. Furthermore, GJB2, KCNH6, and KCNN4 were oncogenic, and GJB2 and KCNN4 were upregulated, while KCNH6 was downregulated in high risk group and GBM cells. The regulatory network showed that KCNH6 was targeted by more miRNA and transcription factors and KCNN4 interacted with more drugs. We constructed a three-signature risk model, which could effectively predict the prognosis of GBM development. Besides, KCNH6 and KCNN4 were respectively considered as the targets of molecular targeted treatment and chemotherapy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39612412/",

While L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) have been associated with cocaine use disorders in humans and drug-seeking in rodents, their role in mood-related symptoms during cocaine abstinence remains unclear. We addressed this by investigating the ability of LTCC blockade with isradipine to alter the mood-related behavioral phenotypes induced by cocaine abstinence. Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine or saline, followed by a 14-day period of abstinence. Subsequently, behavioral responses were examined using the sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated plus maze (EPM), and forced swim test (FST). Cocaine-abstinent rats showed decreased open arm time in the EPM and increased immobility time in the FST with no changes in the SPT. Isradipine (0.4 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg, i.p.), reversed the anxiogenic-like EPM behavior in female cocaine-abstinent rats, whereas only the higher dose (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) was effective in male cocaine-abstinent rats. In the FST, the lower dose (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) of isradipine reversed the increased immobility time observed in cocaine-abstinent female and male rats, with no isradipine effect in saline-abstinent rats. In contrast 1.2 mg/kg, i.p. isradipine decreased immobility time in both cocaine and saline abstinent female and male rats. In summary, isradipine administration reversed the anxiogenic and increased the FST immobility time associated with cocaine abstinence in a dose and sex-dependent manner.

Based on the targeted analysis and suspected screening, this study investigated the distribution of psychotropic drugs and their transformation products (TPs) within the entire treatment processes in WWTPs and their receiving rivers. The results indicated that 13 out of 47 psychotropic drugs are widely observed across wastewater, sludge, receiving river water, and sediment, respectively.

The ubiquitous occurrence of psychotropic drugs in the environment evoked rising concerns due to their various toxic effect on non-target organisms at low concentrations. However, the removal, transformation, and discharging of these drugs throughout wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have rarely been reported. Based on the targeted analysis and suspected screening, this study investigated the distribution of psychotropic drugs and their transformation products (TPs) within the entire treatment processes in WWTPs and their receiving rivers. The results indicated that 13 out of 47 psychotropic drugs are widely observed across wastewater, sludge, receiving river water, and sediment, respectively. The aqueous removal efficiencies of most psychotropic drugs exhibited their significant recalcitrance in wastewater treatment processes. For instance, venlafaxine (VEL) was slightly removed by 2.64 % and 10.8 % in these two WWTPs. The concentrations of oxazepam (OZP) and lamotrigine (LMT) dramatically increased after the overall treatment processes due to their metabolic conversion and regeneration processes, respectively. Given the recalcitrance of psychotropic drugs, the identified TPs generated within WWTPs were not abundant, but a wider variety of TPs were identified from human metabolites. A total of 25 TPs were identified via the suspect screening analysis, of which nine were newly identified. In receiving rivers, the risk quotient (RQ) presented OZP, sertraline (SER), and VEL posed high potential risks; the integration of the toxicological priority index (ToxPi) and the toxicity-weighted concentration (TWC) suggested TP-CIT-322 and TP-OCX-195 as the high-priority contaminants.

This study examined various aspects of allergic reactions, their causes, mechanisms of development, and prevalence in dental practice. The purpose of the study was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of allergic reactions, their classification, clinical manifestations, and mechanisms of development, and to identify the most common causes of such reactions. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted. As a result of the study, different types of allergic reactions and mechanisms of their development were identified. Among them, special attention was paid to immediate hypersensitivity reactions mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE). Delayed-type reactions mediated by sensitised T lymphocytes were also considered. Pseudoallergic reactions occupied a separate place in the classification of allergic reactions. The study emphasised the importance of cross-reactions, in which several structurally similar molecules bind to the same IgE antibodies or T lymphocytes. The main results of the study showed that allergic reactions can be triggered by a variety of allergens. Prominent among these were local anaesthetics such as lidocaine and benzocaine, antibiotics including penicillins and cephalosporins, latex products such as gloves and cofferdams, acrylic materials used in dental prostheses and fillings, and metal alloys containing nickel, chromium, and cobalt.

The study emphasised the importance of cross-reactions, in which several structurally similar molecules bind to the same IgE antibodies or T lymphocytes. The main results of the study showed that allergic reactions can be triggered by a variety of allergens. Prominent among these were local anaesthetics such as lidocaine and benzocaine, antibiotics including penicillins and cephalosporins, latex products such as gloves and cofferdams, acrylic materials used in dental prostheses and fillings, and metal alloys containing nickel, chromium, and cobalt. The study has contributed to a better understanding of the factors causing allergic reactions in dental practice and the mechanisms of their development. This is important for improving the diagnosis and management of such cases, thereby improving the quality of dental care provided.",

However, its impact on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of LOR on the conjugative transfer of ARGs and elucidated the potential mechanisms through transcriptome analysis. The results showed that LOR significantly promoted the frequency of conjugative transfer up to 1.5- to 8.6-fold higher compared with the control group. Exposure to LOR increased reactive oxidative species (ROS) and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, leading to the upregulation of expression of genes related to transmembrane transport and SOS response. Meanwhile, it stimulated the increase of cell membrane permeability. Moreover, LOR exposure could enhance H+ efflux in donor bacteria, resulting in the decrease of intracellular pH and the elevation of transmembrane potential, which could induce the increase of ion transport, thereby promoting plasmid efflux from the cell membrane. Based on this, we inferred that LOR can induce an increase in ROS level and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and promoted the efflux of intracellular H+. This, in turn, triggered the intensification of various ion transport processes on the cell membrane, thereby increasing membrane permeability and accelerating plasmid efflux. Ultimately, the coeffect of oxidative stress response and ion transport promoted conjugative transfer. This study demonstrated that LOR significantly promotes plasmid-mediated conjugative transfer of ARGs, providing novel insights into the mechanisms underlying this process.",
