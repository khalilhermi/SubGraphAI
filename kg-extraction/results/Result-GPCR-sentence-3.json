Despite a range of treatment options, including fluid restriction, demeclocycline, and vasopressin antagonists, urea remains underutilized, particularly in North America, despite its well-documented efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Urea corrects hyponatremia by promoting osmotic diuresis without causing significant fluid shifts, making it an ideal treatment for both acute and chronic SIADH. Comparative studies have demonstrated urea's effectiveness, particularly in contrast to vasopressin antagonists, which are costly and pose risks such as hepatotoxicity and rapid sodium overcorrection. However, barriers to urea's utilization include limited clinician familiarity, lack of advocacy in guidelines, and patient adherence issues due to its unpalatable taste, although flavored formulations now address this issue. Increased awareness, training, and guideline inclusion could promote urea as a viable, primary treatment for SIADH. This editorial advocates for the expanded adoption of urea in clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings where high-cost treatments may not be feasible.",

Both targeted dendritic cells (DC) and particularly leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DC<sub>leu</sub>) can exert potent anti-leukemic activity. By converting AML blasts into immune activating and leukemia-antigen presenting cells, DC/DC<sub>leu</sub>-generating protocols can induce immune responses against AML blasts. Such protocols combine approved response modifiers (i.e., GM-CSF and PGE<sub>1</sub>/OK-432/PGE<sub>2</sub>) that synergistically improve the conversion of AML blasts into (mature) DC/DC<sub>leu</sub>. To guide potential clinical application of these response modifiers, we analyzed three different DC-generating protocols that combine a constant GM-CSF dose with varying concentrations of PGE<sub>1</sub> (Kit-M), OK-432 (Kit-I), and PGE<sub>2</sub> (Kit-K). Here, we specifically aimed to assess how different response modifier concentrations impact DC/DC<sub>leu</sub> generation, immune cell activation and leukemic blast lysis. We found that all immunomodulatory kits were effective in generating mature and leukemia-derived DCs from healthy and leukemic whole blood. For Kit-M, we noted optimal generation of DC-subsets at intermediary concentration ranges of PGE<sub>1</sub> (0.25-4.0 Âµg/mL), which facilitated upregulation of activated and memory T-cells upon mixed lymphocyte culture, and efficient anti-leukemic activity in cytotoxicity assays. For Kit-I, we observed DC/DC<sub>leu</sub> generation and enhanced T- and immune cell activation across a broader range of OK-432 concentrations (5-40 Âµg/mL), which also facilitated improved leukemic blast killing. In conclusion, our results highlight that Kit-mediated DC/DC<sub>leu</sub> generation, immune cell activation and blast lysis are dependent on the concentration of response modifiers, which will guide future clinical development.

Here, we develop a cell line in the HEK293 background that stably expresses functional Î±9Î±10 nAChRs.

We then apply our Î±9Î±10 cell line in a screen of FDA-approved and investigational drugs to identify Î±9Î±10 ligands that provide new tools to probe Î±9Î±10 nAChR function.

These indices are pivotal in the physicochemical characterization and predictive assessment of various drugs. In this study, we calculate several degree-based topological indices for a range of migraine treatment medications, including aspirin, caffeine, eletriptan, ergotamine, sumatriptan, rizatriptan, verapamil, diclofenac, frovatriptan, and droperidol. The process involves several steps: data collection on the molecular structures of migraine drugs and their corresponding biological activities, followed by the calculation of descriptors that represent key features of molecules.

In general, binding of ET-1 to the ETA receptor causes vasoconstriction, whereas activation of the ETB receptor leads to vasodilation. In the kidney, endothelin receptors regulate fluid and electrolyte balance, regional blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. In pathological conditions, ET-1 promotes kidney injury through adverse effects on the endothelial glycocalyx, podocytes and mesangial cells, and stimulating inflammation and fibrosis in the tubules. In experimental and clinical studies, inhibition of the ETA receptor has been shown beneficial in a variety of kidney diseases. These include diabetic kidney disease, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and Alport syndrome. Accordingly, selective ETA endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) may prove a viable therapeutic option in these diseases. However, clinical application is challenged by the occurrence of fluid retention which can lead to heart failure, in particular in patients with severe CKD. Concomitant use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) may mitigate these adverse effects through their diuretic actions. The development of highly selective ETA antagonists, such as atrasentan and zibotentan, and the opportunities of combining these with SGLT2i, holds promise to optimize efficacy and safety of ERAs in clinical practice. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39907539/",

The blockade of gap junctions using carbenoxolone (CBX) increased the levels of ovarian cAMP and pre-granulosa cell phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), suggesting that oocyte PDEs hydrolyze cAMP from pre-granulosa cells through gap junctions to maintain primordial follicle dormancy. Importantly, oral aminophylline improved ovulated oocyte quantity and quality, and increased offspring numbers in naturally aged mice. In addition, theophylline derivatives also activated human primordial follicles and increased p-Akt levels. Thus, theophylline derivatives activate primordial follicles by accumulating cAMP levels and activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in oocytes, and oral aminophylline increased fertility in naturally aged female mice by improving ovulated oocyte quantity and quality. As oral medications, theophylline derivatives may be used to improve fertility in elderly women and patients with POI.",

Since its role in humans is not fully defined, we used an unbiased computational approach to assess the clinical significance of rare G-protein-coupled receptor 37-like 1 (GPR37L1) genetic variants found among 51,289 whole-exome sequences from the DiscovEHR cohort. Rare GPR37L1 coding variants were binned according to predicted pathogenicity and analyzed by sequence kernel association testing to reveal significant associations with disease diagnostic codes for epilepsy and migraine, among others. Since associations do not prove causality, rare GPR37L1 variants were functionally analyzed in SK-N-MC cells to evaluate potential signaling differences and pathogenicity. Notably, receptor variants exhibited varying abilities to reduce cAMP levels, activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and/or upregulate receptor expression in response to the agonist prosaptide (TX14(A)), as compared with the wild-type receptor. In addition to signaling changes, knock-out (KO) of GPR37L1 or expression of certain rare variants altered cellular cholesterol levels, which were also acutely regulated by administration of the agonist TX14(A) via activation of the MAPK pathway. Finally, to simulate the impact of rare nonsense variants found in the large patient cohort, a KO mouse line lacking Gpr37l1 was generated. Although KO animals did not recapitulate an acute migraine phenotype, the loss of this receptor produced sex-specific changes in anxiety-related disorders often seen in chronic migraineurs. Collectively, these observations define the existence of rare GPR37L1 variants associated with neuropsychiatric conditions in the human population and identify the signaling changes contributing to pathological processes.",

To our knowledge, the possibility that the activation of any one of the multitudes of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed by a single cell-type might increase EV release has not been explored. Recently, we identified the expression of cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin, gastrin/cholecystokinin types A and/or B receptors (CCKAR and/or -BR), and the bitter taste receptor, TAS2R14 in the human and mouse placenta. specifically, trophoblast. These GPCR(s) were also expressed in four different human trophoblast cell lines. The current objective was to employ two of these cell lines-JAR choriocarcinoma cells and HTR-8/SVneo cells derived from first-trimester human villous trophoblast-to investigate whether CCK, TAS2R14 agonists, and other GPCR ligands would each augment EV release. EVs were isolated from the cell-culture medium by filtration and ultracentrifugation. The preparations were enriched in small EVs (<200Â nm) as determined by syntenin western blot before and after sucrose gradient purification, phycoerythrin (PE)-ADAM10 antibody labeling, and electron microscopy. Activation of TAS2R14, CCKBR, cholinergic muscarinic 1 & 3, and angiotensin II receptors, each increased EV release by 4.91-, 2.79-, 1.87-, and 3.11-fold, respectively (all p < .05 versus vehicle controls), without significantly changing EV diameter. A progressive increase of EV concentration in conditioned medium was observed over 24Â hr consistent with the release of preformed EVs and de novo biogenesis. Compared to receptor-mediated stimulation, EV release by the calcium ionophore, A23187, was less robust (1.63-fold, p = .08). Diphenhydramine, a TAS2R14 agonist, enhanced EV release in JAR cells at a concentration 10-fold below that required to increase intracellular calcium. CCK activation of HTR-8/SVneo cells, which did not raise intracellular calcium, increased EV release by 2.06-fold (p < .05). Taken together, these results suggested that other signaling pathways may underlie receptor-stimulated EV release besides, or in addition to, calcium. To our knowledge, the finding that the activation of multiple GPCRs can stimulate EV release from a single cell-type is unprecedented and engenders a novel thesis that each receptor may orchestrate intercellular communication through the release of EVs containing a subset of unique cargo, thus mobilizing a specific integrated physiological response by a network of neighboring and distant cells.",

The morphology of ZPS presented the smooth surface, spherical nanoparticle, and irregular network structure. ZPS demonstrated thermal stability and emulsification activity. ZPS potently stimulated macrophage phagocytic function and effectively inhibited the migration of cancer cells, thereby enhancing overall immunomodulatory activity. Additionally, ZPS featured cryoprotective activity and flocculation property. Overall, the multiple activity of ZPS hold tremendous potential in the food and pharmaceutical industries, offering new dimensions for novel microbial exopolysaccharides.",

Histological examination revealed that miRNA-21 restored healthy Î²-cell architecture, decreased cleaved-caspase-3, and increased insulin secretion. Transmission electron microscopy revealed increased mitochondrial circularity that significantly correlated with an exaggerated oxidative stress profile as shown by high serum and pancreatic malondialdehyde (MDA), low glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity in STZ-induced diabetes. This oxidative profile was reversed using miRNA-21-CS-NPs. Mi-RNA-21 therapy downregulated PTEN but increased AKT and pAKT expression. Altogether, we show that miRNA-21 restored normal islet Î²-cell structure and insulin secretion through PTEN inhibition.",

In this study, we established a deep learning-based predictive model, utilizing a data set comprised of compounds known to either elevate or lower blood pressure. Subsequently, the trained model was used to predict the blood pressure-lowering effects of 26,000 compounds. Based on the predicted results, we randomly selected 50 molecules for validation and compared them with literature reports.

We further selected 10 of these molecules and 3 related protein targets for molecular docking, and the docking results indirectly confirmed the model's accuracy. Ultimately, we discovered and validated that salaprinol significantly inhibits ACE1 activity and lowers canine blood pressure.

Histamine is a critical neurotransmitter and promotes inflammatory responses; thus, the histaminergic system is a potential target for treating neurodegenerative processes. JNJ-7777120, a histamine H4 receptor (H4R) antagonist, has been shown to alleviate inflammation, brain damage, and behavioral deficits effectively, but there is no report on its role in brain trauma. Herein, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of JNJ-7777120 (shortly JNJ) in a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). mTBI setup was performed using a weight-drop model in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. JNJ (1 mg/kg, twice/day for 7 days) was intraperitoneally administered following mTBI. Modified neurological severity score and beam-walking test used to assess motor, sensory, reflex, and balance functions (post-TBI days-1/3/7) showed that JNJ had significantly improved these functions. HE-staining revealed reduced neurodegenerative cells after JNJ-treatments compared to vehicle (2.85 % DMSO) treated group. JNJ also decreased the injury-induced apoptosis (Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved-Cas-3, cleaved-PARP1), oxidative (4HNE, MDA), and inflammatory (IBA1, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, and IL-10) responses. Furthermore, blocking the activation of the ERK1/2/NF-ÎºB pathway was determined to be involved in its therapeutic mechanism. The network pharmacology analyses for JNJ-7777120 and TBI confirmed the importance of targeting neurotransmitter receptor activity, signaling receptor activity, and kinase activation. Our results provide the first proof of the efficacy of an H4R antagonist in a mild TBI rat model and suggest that H4R targeting by JNJ-treatment might be a promising therapeutic approach to clinically halt the progression of brain injury.",

In this paper, we reported a case of a 36-year-old man who had a giant hepatic angiomyolipoma with spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage. The patient was admitted to our hospital with sudden upper abdominal pain for 3âh. A giant tumor was found in the left and caudate lobes of the liver, as well as significant blood collection around the liver and in the pelvis. Hemoglobin, liver function test results, and serum tumor maker levels were all within normal ranges. To prevent bleeding, emergency angiography and embolization were performed. During angiography, it was discovered that the tumor was supplied by the left hepatic artery and had a very rich internal blood supply. A massive left hepatic mass of about 11âcm in diameter was found bulging from the surface of the liver and rupturing there during laparoscopic exploration a week later. The rupture was strongly adhered to the smaller curvature of the stomach. The patient underwent laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy and caudate lobectomy, and the tumor specimen was brown, with clear boundaries with the surrounding normal liver parenchyma, and there were a large number of necrotic lesions inside the tumor. Histopathological results confirmed the mass as hepatic angiomyolipoma with negative resection margins. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that the tumor had positive homatropine methylbromide-45. After 13 months of follow-up, no tumor recurrence or metastasis occurred in the patient.",
