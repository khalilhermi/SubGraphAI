Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified significant enrichment of rare, deleterious mutations in PPIL4, encoding peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 4, in both familial and index IA cases. Ppil4 depletion in vertebrate models causes intracerebral hemorrhage, defects in cerebrovascular morphology and impaired Wnt signaling.

The results of real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses indicated that HEP upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), subsequently upregulated the expression of liver fatty acid oxidation-related genes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT-1a), and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1)) and downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1), and fatty acid synthase (FASN)), thereby ameliorating lipid metabolism disorders. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that HEP exerted protective effects on lipid metabolism disorders by activating the PPARα pathway, indicating its potential as a dietary supplement for the prevention and amelioration of obesity.",

To date, CROT function in the context of calcification potential has been conducted in the dyslipidemic low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice. Objectives: To differentiate peroxisome and CROT-dependent lipid biology from that of lipoprotein-mediated lipid biology, we therefore conducted a metabolomic analysis of the liver and plasma of normolipidemic CROT-deficient (Crot-/-) mice. Methods: We performed LC-MS-based metabolomics on liver and plasma derived from Crot-/- and Crot +/- mice and sibling Crot+/+ mice, using a dual-phase metabolite extraction protocol, and multiple LC-MS acquisition strategies. Results: We identified between 79 to 453 annotated metabolites from annotated metabolites from liver samples, and 117 to 424 annotated metabolites from plasma samples. Through differential abundance analysis, we determined that omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA, DPA, and DHA were higher in the liver of Crot-/- and Crot +/- mice than Crot+/+ mice. EPA were higher in plasma of Crot-/- mice than Crot+/+ mice. We also determined that the anti-inflammatory dicarboxylic acids, tetradecanedioic acid and azelaic acid, were higher in the plasma of CROT-deficient mice. Conclusion: Our study associated genetic CROT deletion with increased levels of anti-inflammatory molecules in mouse liver and plasma. These results suggest a potential mechanism for anti-calcification effects of CROT suppression and the potential use of omega-3 fatty acids as biomarkers for future CROT inhibition therapies.",

Methods: We performed LC-MS-based metabolomics on liver and plasma derived from Crot-/- and Crot +/- mice and sibling Crot+/+ mice, using a dual-phase metabolite extraction protocol, and multiple LC-MS acquisition strategies. Results: We identified between 79 to 453 annotated metabolites from annotated metabolites from liver samples, and 117 to 424 annotated metabolites from plasma samples. Through differential abundance analysis, we determined that omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA, DPA, and DHA were higher in the liver of Crot-/- and Crot +/- mice than Crot+/+ mice. EPA were higher in plasma of Crot-/- mice than Crot+/+ mice. We also determined that the anti-inflammatory dicarboxylic acids, tetradecanedioic acid and azelaic acid, were higher in the plasma of CROT-deficient mice. Conclusion: Our study associated genetic CROT deletion with increased levels of anti-inflammatory molecules in mouse liver and plasma. These results suggest a potential mechanism for anti-calcification effects of CROT suppression and the potential use of omega-3 fatty acids as biomarkers for future CROT inhibition therapies.",

Human milk (HM) carries contains 3-5% fat, 0.8-0.9% protein, 6.9-7.2% carbohydrate calculated as lactose, and 0.2% mineral constituents. Most of these nutrients are carried in these MFGs, which are composed of an energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) core surrounded by a triple membrane structure. The membrane contains polar lipids, specialized proteins, glycoproteins, and cholesterol. Each of these bioactive components serves important nutritional, immunological, neurological, and digestive functions. These MFGs are designed to release energy rapidly in the upper gastrointestinal tract and then persist for some time in the gut lumen so that the protective bioactive molecules are conveyed to the colon. These properties may shape the microbial colonization and innate immune properties of the developing gastrointestinal tract. Milk fat globules in milk from humans and ruminants may resemble in structure but there are considerable differences in size, profile, composition, and specific constituents. There are possibilities to not only enhance the nutritional composition in a goal-oriented fashion to correct specific deficiencies in the infant but also to use these fat globules as a nutraceutical in infants who require specific treatments. To mention a few, there might be possibilities in enhancing neurodevelopment, in defense against gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections, improving insulin sensitivity, treating chronic inflammation, and altering plasma lipids.

            "source": "We included two studies with a total of 308 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (220 men and 85 women). A total of 223 participants received lurasidone (20, 40, or 80 mg/day), and 82 received haloperidol (up to 10 mg/day) or perphenazine (up to 32 mg/day); three people did not receive any study medication. Both studies were performed in the US. The duration of the follow-up was four to six weeks. Death by suicide/natural causes and quality of life were not reported by the two included studies. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of lurasidone on change in mental state: the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (MD 3.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 6.90; 1 RCT, 281 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (MD 6.68, 95% CI 2.45 to 10.91; 1 RCT, 281 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is also very uncertain about the effects of lurasidone on total serious adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.60; 2 RCTs, 303 participants; very low certainty of evidence) and on severe adverse events (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.32; 1 RCT, 281 participants; very low certainty of evidence).",

In addition, the growing usage of antidepressants worldwide and increase in mental health disorders were shown in recent statistical analyses conducted by the World Health Organisation. The coadministration of caffeine and antidepressants remains a concern due to potential interactions that can alter a patient's response to therapy. This review investigates the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between caffeine and the five main classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and other antidepressants not categorised by class, which we have categorised as 'miscellaneous'. The interaction between fluvoxamine and caffeine resulted in increased concentrations of caffeine in the body and lowered the renal clearance of fluvoxamine. Other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and escitalopram had augmented antidepressant effects by decreasing their renal clearance and prolonging their effects in the body when coadministered with caffeine. Caffeine may also increase the concentration of paroxetine, potentially affecting its pharmacodynamic effects. TCAs such as clomipramine, imipramine, desipramine, and sertraline, were found to reduce the metabolism of caffeine. However, studies suggest caffeine had no significant effect on the concentration of these medications in blood or brain tissue. The inhibition of caffeine at high doses when used with MAOIs such as tranylcypromine and phenelzine was found to lead to a higher likelihood of experiencing hypertension. Coadministration of caffeine with venlafaxine (SNRIs) suggests minimal interactions between the two substances and the pharmacodynamic effects of venlafaxine were unlikely to be impacted by caffeine consumption. Miscellaneous antidepressants (reboxetine, mianserin, agomelatine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine) displayed varying pharmacodynamic interactions with caffeine, resulting in increased antidepressant effects where vortioxetine, maprotiline, and mirtazapine failed to demonstrate any interactions. In conclusion, caffeine demonstrated varying effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of each class of antidepressants, with several classes of antidepressants demonstrating a similar effect on caffeine.",

Evidence suggests that Cyc/CDK targets extend beyond traditional proteins and include enzymes that regulate the central carbon metabolism. Maize embryo axes rapidly internalize and metabolize glucose. After 24 h of imbibition in glucose-rich media, axes exhibited increased length and weight, with more pronounced effects at 72 h. This morphology enhancement was impaired when RO-3306, a specific CDK inhibitor, was added. The protein profile of maize embryo extracts at 18 and 24 h indicated altered phosphorylation patterns following CDK activity inhibition. Metabolomic analysis at 24 h of imbibition revealed that maize embryos without sugar in the media, with or without RO-3306, had a decreased sugar and amino acid content. Conversely, axes exposed to glucose demonstrated increased conversion into various mono and di-saccharides such as fructose, mannitol, galactose, and maltose but not sucrose. This pattern was reversed upon the addition of RO-3306. Glucose promoted the accumulation of amino acids such as cysteine, valine, leucine, and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, such as malate and citrate. The CDK inhibitor redirected the glucose metabolism toward increased serine levels, followed by other amino acids like phenylalanine, valine, and leucine. Additionally, TCA cycle intermediates and sterols significantly decreased. Overall, these results contribute to understanding the role of CDK in maize morphogenesis during germination and underscore its impact on modulating various central carbon pathways, including glycolysis, amino acid catabolism/anabolism, TCA cycle, and sterols biosynthesis.",

Evidence suggests that Cyc/CDK targets extend beyond traditional proteins and include enzymes that regulate the central carbon metabolism. Maize embryo axes rapidly internalize and metabolize glucose. After 24 h of imbibition in glucose-rich media, axes exhibited increased length and weight, with more pronounced effects at 72 h. This morphology enhancement was impaired when RO-3306, a specific CDK inhibitor, was added. The protein profile of maize embryo extracts at 18 and 24 h indicated altered phosphorylation patterns following CDK activity inhibition. Metabolomic analysis at 24 h of imbibition revealed that maize embryos without sugar in the media, with or without RO-3306, had a decreased sugar and amino acid content. Conversely, axes exposed to glucose demonstrated increased conversion into various mono and di-saccharides such as fructose, mannitol, galactose, and maltose but not sucrose. This pattern was reversed upon the addition of RO-3306. Glucose promoted the accumulation of amino acids such as cysteine, valine, leucine, and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, such as malate and citrate. The CDK inhibitor redirected the glucose metabolism toward increased serine levels, followed by other amino acids like phenylalanine, valine, and leucine. Additionally, TCA cycle intermediates and sterols significantly decreased. Overall, these results contribute to understanding the role of CDK in maize morphogenesis during germination and underscore its impact on modulating various central carbon pathways, including glycolysis, amino acid catabolism/anabolism, TCA cycle, and sterols biosynthesis.",

Here, we report the case of an 11 year-old girl presenting interstitial lung disease, supratentorial leukoencephalopathy with brain cysts, hepatic dysfunction, hypoalbuminemia, skin and joint hyperlaxity, growth retardation, and dysmorphic features. In addition, our patient also developed two clinical features never reported before: hypergammaglobulinemia and myopic chorioretinitis. Methods: NGS analysis of the patient's skin-derived DNA revealed two novel biallelic variants in FARSA gene (NM_004461.3) never described before: the maternal nonsense variant, c.799C>T [p.(Gln267Ter)], and the paternal missense variant, c.737T>C [p.(Met246Thr)], both predicted as deleterious. Results: From a therapeutic perspective, this young girl has been enrolled in a clinical trial with Nintedanib, in order to treat the severe pulmonary fibrosis, with interesting initial results.

However, the key physiological metabolic pathways and molecular regulatory mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, this study used physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomics methods to analyze the key genes and metabolites involved in the NO regulation of plant embryo germination and their potential regulatory mechanisms. The physiological analysis results indicate that the appropriate concentration of NO increased the content of NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in cells, stimulated the synthesis of ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA), induced a decrease in abscisic acid (ABA) content, antagonistic to the gibberellin (GA3) effect, and promoted embryo germination and subsequent seedling growth. However, the high concentrations of NO caused excessive accumulation of H2O2, destroyed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, and inhibited embryo germination and seedling growth. The combined analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics showed that the genes related to phenylpropanoid (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase, ferulate-5-hydroxylase, coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase), and flavonoid synthesis (10 genes such as CHS) were significantly up-regulated during embryo germination. The high concentration of exogenous NO inhibited embryo germination by up-regulating the expression of 4-coumaric acid coenzyme A ligase (4CL) and negatively regulating the expression of flavonoid synthesis genes. This suggests that NO concentration-dependently regulates phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, thereby affecting ROS metabolism and hormone levels, and ultimately regulates the dormancy and germination of Sorbus pohuashanensis embryos.",

However, the key physiological metabolic pathways and molecular regulatory mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, this study used physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomics methods to analyze the key genes and metabolites involved in the NO regulation of plant embryo germination and their potential regulatory mechanisms. The physiological analysis results indicate that the appropriate concentration of NO increased the content of NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in cells, stimulated the synthesis of ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA), induced a decrease in abscisic acid (ABA) content, antagonistic to the gibberellin (GA3) effect, and promoted embryo germination and subsequent seedling growth. However, the high concentrations of NO caused excessive accumulation of H2O2, destroyed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, and inhibited embryo germination and seedling growth. The combined analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics showed that the genes related to phenylpropanoid (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase, ferulate-5-hydroxylase, coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase), and flavonoid synthesis (10 genes such as CHS) were significantly up-regulated during embryo germination. The high concentration of exogenous NO inhibited embryo germination by up-regulating the expression of 4-coumaric acid coenzyme A ligase (4CL) and negatively regulating the expression of flavonoid synthesis genes. This suggests that NO concentration-dependently regulates phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, thereby affecting ROS metabolism and hormone levels, and ultimately regulates the dormancy and germination of Sorbus pohuashanensis embryos.",

Therefore, this study used physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomics methods to analyze the key genes and metabolites involved in the NO regulation of plant embryo germination and their potential regulatory mechanisms. The physiological analysis results indicate that the appropriate concentration of NO increased the content of NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in cells, stimulated the synthesis of ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA), induced a decrease in abscisic acid (ABA) content, antagonistic to the gibberellin (GA3) effect, and promoted embryo germination and subsequent seedling growth. However, the high concentrations of NO caused excessive accumulation of H2O2, destroyed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, and inhibited embryo germination and seedling growth. The combined analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics showed that the genes related to phenylpropanoid (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase, ferulate-5-hydroxylase, coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase), and flavonoid synthesis (10 genes such as CHS) were significantly up-regulated during embryo germination.

Here we show that IGF-1 also regulates phagocytosis of reactive astrocytes through p110α isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), differentially in both sexes. Systemic bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treatment increased the expression of GFAP, a reactive astrocyte marker, in the cortex of mice in both sexes and was blocked by IGF-1 only in males. In primary astrocytes, LPS enhanced the mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR2,4) and proinflammatory factors: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), chemokine interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) in male and female. Treatment with IGF-1 counteracted TLR4 but not TLR2, iNOS, and IP10 expression in both sexes and cytokines expression in males. Furthermore, reactive astrocyte phagocytosis was modulated by IGF-1 only in male astrocytes. IGF-1 was also able to increase AKT-phosphorylation only in male astrocytes. PI3K inhibitors, AG66, TGX-221, and CAL-101, with selectivity toward catalytic p110α, p110β, and p110δ isoforms respectively, reduced AKT-phosphorylation in males. All isoforms interact physically with IGF-1-receptor in both sexes. However, the expression of p110α is higher in males while the expression of IGF-1-receptor is similar in male and female. AG66 suppressed the IGF-1 effect on cytokine expression and counteracted the IGF-1-produced phagocytosis decrease in male reactive astrocytes. Results suggest that sex-differences in the effect of IGF-1 on the AKT-phosphorylation could be due to a lower expression of the p110α in female and that IGF-1-effects on the inflammatory response and phagocytosis of male reactive astrocytes are mediated by p110α/PI3K subunit.",

In primary astrocytes, LPS enhanced the mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR2,4) and proinflammatory factors: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), chemokine interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) in male and female. Treatment with IGF-1 counteracted TLR4 but not TLR2, iNOS, and IP10 expression in both sexes and cytokines expression in males. Furthermore, reactive astrocyte phagocytosis was modulated by IGF-1 only in male astrocytes. IGF-1 was also able to increase AKT-phosphorylation only in male astrocytes. PI3K inhibitors, AG66, TGX-221, and CAL-101, with selectivity toward catalytic p110α, p110β, and p110δ isoforms respectively, reduced AKT-phosphorylation in males. All isoforms interact physically with IGF-1-receptor in both sexes. However, the expression of p110α is higher in males while the expression of IGF-1-receptor is similar in male and female. AG66 suppressed the IGF-1 effect on cytokine expression and counteracted the IGF-1-produced phagocytosis decrease in male reactive astrocytes. Results suggest that sex-differences in the effect of IGF-1 on the AKT-phosphorylation could be due to a lower expression of the p110α in female and that IGF-1-effects on the inflammatory response and phagocytosis of male reactive astrocytes are mediated by p110α/PI3K subunit.",

The outcome of PMN can vary, but untreated patients with NS may progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in 35-40% of cases within 10 years. Treatment primarily aims to prevent NS complications and progression to ESKD. The most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs are rituximab, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and calcineurin inhibitors. Most patients may experience an improvement of proteinuria, which can sometimes be followed by NS relapse. Fewer than 50% of patients with PMN achieve complete and stable remission. In addition to immunosuppressive therapy, antiproteinuric, anti-lipemic, and anticoagulant medicaments are often required.",

By preventing lipid peroxidation and maintaining membrane integrity, GPX4 acts as a safeguard against cell death pathways, particularly ferroptosis, in skin diseases. Dysregulation of GPX4 in conditions such as dermatitis, psoriasis, and skin cancer is linked to heightened oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue damage. Understanding the role of GPX4 and its intricate interactions in skin disease pathogenesis can aid in more effectively targeting oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to promising therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes the role of GPX4 in maintaining skin homeostasis and its involvement in disease, proposing strategies to target GPX4, including its post-translational modifications. Investigate the precise mechanism through which GPX4 influences the onset of skin diseases, and utilize GPX4 agonists or inhibitors as potential treatments.",

However, the role of serine metabolism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that serine starvation predominantly inhibits ESCC cell proliferation by suppressing purine nucleotides and NADPH synthesis. Mechanistically, serine depletion led to the accumulation of aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), an intermediate metabolite of de novo purine synthesis, and AMP/ATP ratio. These increases activated 5'-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which subsequently inhibited the mTORC1 pathway by phosphorylating Raptor at Ser792. Moreover, serine depletion decreased NADPH level followed by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage, which induced p53-p21 mediated G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Conversely, serine starvation activated transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-mediated robust expression of phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) which in turn promoted compensatory endogenous serine synthesis, thus maintaining ESCC cell survival under serine-limited conditions. Accordingly, serine deprivation combined with PSAT1 inhibition significantly suppressed ESCC tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that serine starvation suppresses the proliferation of ESCC cells by disturbing the synthesis of purine nucleotides and NADPH, and the combination of serine deprivation and PSAT1 inhibition significantly impairs ESCC tumor growth.

Upon reaching the tumor tissue, protease-facilitated depegylation of pegylated zinc protoporphyrin with ester bonds between PEG and ZnPP (esPEG-ZnPP) occurs, leading to a faster cellular uptake and superior antitumor efficacy compared to PEG-ZnPP with ether bonds (etPEG-ZnPP). This finding provides a viable strategy for achieving efficient tumor-specific drug release by utilizing an ester linkage between PEG and antitumor drugs. Another strategy involves using styrene-maleic acid copolymer (SMA), an amphiphilic polymer. Drug-encapsulating SMA aggregates disintegrate upon interaction with cell membrane components, releasing the encapsulated active drug. The author has demonstrated an improvement in the tumor accumulation of SMA-based macromolecular drugs by conjugating pirarubicin (THP), an anthracycline antitumor drug, with SMA. Furthermore, by conjugating various molecular weights of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) to THP via a hydrazone bond (P-THP, DP-THP, and SP-THP), the author has established a positive correlation between HPMA molecular weight and therapeutic efficacy as well as toxicity. Notably, P-THPs release THP under acidic conditions within tumor tissue; however, this release occurs solely outside tumor cells due to HPMA-mediated inhibition of cellular uptake. The author is currently developing macromolecular anticancer drugs using albumin for the tumor-targeted release of anticancer agents both intra- and extracellularly. The strategic development of tumor-targeting macromolecular antitumor drugs based on a comprehensive understanding of polymer characteristics and the tumor-specific environment is imperative for effective cancer therapy.",

While sulfated alginate microbeads reduce fibrosis and inflammation, fucoidan, a kelp-derived polysaccharide rich in sulfate groups, has not been evaluated in this context. The study assesses surface reactivity to acute-phase proteins and cytokines using ex vivo human whole blood and plasma models. It also examines pericapsular overgrowth (PFO) in C57BL/6JRj mice, incorporating protein pattern mapping through LC-MS/MS proteomics. Fucoidan alginate microbeads activated complement and coagulation, while both fucoidan and sulfated alginate microbeads induced plasmin activity. Fucoidan alginate microbeads exhibited a distinct cytokine profile, characterized by high levels of MCP-1, IL-8, IFN-γ, and reduced levels of RANTES, Eotaxin, PDGF-BB, TGF-β isoforms, along with higher PFO. The balance between plasmin activity and coagulation emerged as a potential predictor of fibrosis resistance, favouring sulfated alginate microbeads. Explanted materials were enriched with both complement and coagulation activators (Complement C1q and C3, Factor 12, Kallikrein, HMW-kininogen) and inhibitors (C1-inhibitor, Factor H, Factor I). Fucoidan alginate microbeads predominantly enriched extracellular matrix factors (Fibrinogen, Collagen, TGF-β, Bmp), while sulfated alginate microbeads favoured ECM-degrading proteases (Metalloproteases and Cathepsins). This study reveals significant differences in host responses to fucoidan and sulfated alginate in microbeads.

The assembly of dynein with dynactin and a cargo adaptor in an active transport complex is facilitated by Lis1 and Nde1/Ndel1. Recent studies proposed that Lis1 relieves dynein from its autoinhibited conformation, but the physiological function of Nde1/Ndel1 remains elusive. Here, we investigate how human Nde1 and Lis1 regulate the assembly and subsequent motility of mammalian dynein using in vitro reconstitution and single molecule imaging. We find that Nde1 recruits Lis1 to autoinhibited dynein and promotes Lis1-mediated assembly of dynein-dynactin adaptor complexes. Nde1 can compete with the α2 subunit of platelet activator factor acetylhydrolase 1B (PAF-AH1B) for the binding of Lis1, which suggests that Nde1 may disrupt PAF-AH1B recruitment of Lis1 as a noncatalytic subunit, thus promoting Lis1 binding to dynein. Before the initiation of motility, the association of dynactin with dynein triggers the dissociation of Nde1 from dynein by competing against Nde1 binding to the dynein intermediate chain.

Arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), an enzyme catalyzing the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, plays a crucial role in various diseases. Here, we sought to investigate the involvement of ALOX15 in MASLD. Results: In this study, we observed upregulation of ALOX15 in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)- and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mice. Metabolomic analysis revealed elevated levels of ALOX15 metabolites, 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the increased fatty acid uptake regulated by the PPARγ/CD36 pathway predominated in lipid accumulation. To elucidate the mechanism underlying ALOX15-induced lipid accumulation, HepG2 cells were transfected with a lentivirus expressing ALOX15 or small interfering RNA targeting ALOX15 and exposed to palmitic acid (PA). Both ALOX15 overexpression and PA exposure led to increased intracellular free fatty acid and triglyceride, resulting in lipotoxicity. ALOX15 overexpression aggravated the effect of PA, while the knockdown of ALOX15 attenuated PA-induced lipotoxicity. Moreover, the treatment with PPARγ antagonist GW9662 or CD36 inhibitor sulfosuccinimidyl oleate sodium effectively reduced lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity resulting from ALOX15 overexpression and PA exposure, indicating the involvement of the PPARγ/CD36 pathway in ALOX15-mediated lipid accumulation. Furthermore, liraglutide, a widely used glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist (GLP-1RA), improved hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD/STZ-induced mice by suppressing the ALOX15/PPARγ/CD36 pathway. Innovation and Conclusion: Our study underscores the potential of ALOX15 as an emerging therapeutic target for MASLD. In addition, the GLP-1RA may confer hepatoprotection by regulating ALOX15, enhancing our comprehension of the mechanisms underpinning their protection on MASLD. Antioxid.

Metabolomic analysis revealed elevated levels of ALOX15 metabolites, 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the increased fatty acid uptake regulated by the PPARγ/CD36 pathway predominated in lipid accumulation. To elucidate the mechanism underlying ALOX15-induced lipid accumulation, HepG2 cells were transfected with a lentivirus expressing ALOX15 or small interfering RNA targeting ALOX15 and exposed to palmitic acid (PA). Both ALOX15 overexpression and PA exposure led to increased intracellular free fatty acid and triglyceride, resulting in lipotoxicity. ALOX15 overexpression aggravated the effect of PA, while the knockdown of ALOX15 attenuated PA-induced lipotoxicity. Moreover, the treatment with PPARγ antagonist GW9662 or CD36 inhibitor sulfosuccinimidyl oleate sodium effectively reduced lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity resulting from ALOX15 overexpression and PA exposure, indicating the involvement of the PPARγ/CD36 pathway in ALOX15-mediated lipid accumulation. Furthermore, liraglutide, a widely used glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist (GLP-1RA), improved hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD/STZ-induced mice by suppressing the ALOX15/PPARγ/CD36 pathway. Innovation and Conclusion: Our study underscores the potential of ALOX15 as an emerging therapeutic target for MASLD. In addition, the GLP-1RA may confer hepatoprotection by regulating ALOX15, enhancing our comprehension of the mechanisms underpinning their protection on MASLD. Antioxid.

Dysregulation of PLOD3 has been implicated in various malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC).This study aimed to elucidate the role of PLOD3 in CRC and evaluate its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. We conducted a comprehensive analysis utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to evaluate PLOD3 expression in CRC. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to investigate its impact on overall survival. Functional assays, including wound healing, Transwell migration, and invasion assays, were carried out in CRC cell lines with modified PLOD3 expression to elucidate its role in regulating tumor cell behavior. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was employed to identify signaling pathways associated with PLOD3 expression. Our findings demonstrate that PLOD3 is significantly overexpressed in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, and its elevated expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival. The study also developed a RiskScore model incorporating PLOD3 and 11 other genes, which exhibited strong predictive performance for patient outcomes. Functional experiments confirmed that PLOD3 overexpression enhances CRC cell migration and invasion. GSEA linked high PLOD3 expression to the activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis-related pathways. In conclusion, PLOD3 plays a pivotal role in CRC progression by promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Its elevated expression serves as an independent prognostic marker and a potential target for therapeutic intervention, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving CRC.",

Crosstalk between nitric oxide (NO) and melatonin (MT) in enhancing crop resilience to heavy metal stress has gained significant attention. Here, we evaluated the joint effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 200 μM as NO donor) and MT (100 μM) on Cd-stressed eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). Cd stress significantly reduced plant growth, biomass yield, leaf pigments, and biochemical properties. Conversely, SNP, MT, and particularly their combined (SNP + MT) application reduced Cd toxicity and enhanced growth and physio-biochemical traits of eggplants. For instance, at 50 mg Cd kg-1 soil, SNP, MT, and SNP + MT increased root biomass (41.6, 30, and 47%), total chlorophyll (30.7, 26.3, and 46%), soluble protein (20.5, 17.6 and 37%) and RLWC (23, 17.5, and 29%) over their respective control. Furthermore, SNP + MT significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced levels of EL, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, proline, and MDA by 54.5, 66, 61 and 70%, respectively, in Cd-stressed eggplants. SNP + MT interplay enhanced antioxidant defense responses in leaf tissues under Cd stress. Besides, SNP and MT upregulated transcript levels of POD, SOD, CAT, and GPX genes in eggplants under Cd stress. SNP and MT applications improved essential nutrient cation homeostasis in Cd-stressed shoot tissues of eggplants. Moreover, SNP + MT lessens metal-induced toxicity by decreasing Cd uptake, translocation (TF) and bioconcentration (BCF) factors. Conclusively, these findings validated the beneficial defensive interaction between SNP and MT in regulating Cd tolerance in eggplants. However, further research is needed to uncover the underlying defensive mechanisms of these synergistic effects.",

The enzymes are targets for chemical probe development because of their roles in cancer cell metabolism (PRODH) and primary hyperoxaluria (PRODH2). Mechanism-based inactivators of PRODH target the FAD by covalently modifying the N5 atom, with N-propargylglycine (NPPG) being the current best-in-class of this type of probe. Here we investigated a close analog of NPPG, but-3-yn-2-ylglycine (B32G), distinguished by having a methyl group adjacent to the ethynyl group of the propargyl warhead. UV-visible spectroscopy shows that a bacterial PRODH catalyzes the oxidation of the S-enantiomer of B32G, a necessary first step in mechanism-based inactivation. In contrast, the enzyme does not react with the R-enantiomer. Enzyme activity assays show that S-B32G inhibits bacterial PRODH in a time-dependent manner consistent with covalent inactivation; however, the inactivation efficiency is ∼600-times lower than NPPG. We generated the crystal structure of PRODH inactivated by S-B32G at 1.68 Å resolution and found that inactivation induces a covalent link between the FAD N5 and the ε-nitrogen of an active site lysine, confirming that S-B32G follows the same mechanism as NPPG. Despite its lower inactivation efficiency at the purified bacterial enzyme, S-B32G exhibited comparable activity to NPPG against PRODH and PRODH2 in human cells and mouse livers.

The enzymes are targets for chemical probe development because of their roles in cancer cell metabolism (PRODH) and primary hyperoxaluria (PRODH2). Mechanism-based inactivators of PRODH target the FAD by covalently modifying the N5 atom, with N-propargylglycine (NPPG) being the current best-in-class of this type of probe. Here we investigated a close analog of NPPG, but-3-yn-2-ylglycine (B32G), distinguished by having a methyl group adjacent to the ethynyl group of the propargyl warhead. UV-visible spectroscopy shows that a bacterial PRODH catalyzes the oxidation of the S-enantiomer of B32G, a necessary first step in mechanism-based inactivation. In contrast, the enzyme does not react with the R-enantiomer. Enzyme activity assays show that S-B32G inhibits bacterial PRODH in a time-dependent manner consistent with covalent inactivation; however, the inactivation efficiency is ∼600-times lower than NPPG. We generated the crystal structure of PRODH inactivated by S-B32G at 1.68 Å resolution and found that inactivation induces a covalent link between the FAD N5 and the ε-nitrogen of an active site lysine, confirming that S-B32G follows the same mechanism as NPPG.

However, currently available diagnostic approaches can only assess the level of inflammation, but not the degree of fibrosis, limiting rational therapeutic management of Crohn's disease patients. Recently, prolyl endopeptidase fibroblast activating protein (FAP) has been functionally implicated in fibrotic tissue remodelling, indicating it as a promising target for detection of sites of fibrotic tissue remodelling. Thus, intestinal fibrosis might be visualized using Gallium-68 labelled inhibitors of FAP (FAPI). While F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is a standard diagnostic tool for visualizing inflammatory processes, we combined Ga-68-FAPI-46-PET/CT and F-18-FDG-PET/CT to differentiate predominantly fibrotic or inflammatory areas in Crohn's disease patients with ileo-colonic strictures.",
