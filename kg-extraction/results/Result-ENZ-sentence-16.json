Based on this, a cocktail of 3 biotinylated probes (targeting α-glucosidases, β-galactosidases and α-fucosidases) was used for target enrichment and three glycoside hydrolase family proteins were identified by mass-spectrometry: 6-phospho-β-glucosidase (BglA), α-amylase family protein trehalase C (TreC), and autolysin (Atl).

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether BP lability directly influences perinatal outcome, or merely reflects peak BP. The difference in BP variability between antihypertensives may reflect varying effectiveness or factors influencing antihypertensive choice. Prospective research is needed to investigate any potential link between antihypertensive medications, BP variability and perinatal outcome.",

Here we present a fully human nitric-oxide-responsive gene-regulation system for the on-demand and localized release of therapeutic proteins through clinically licensed nitroglycerin patches. Designed for simplicity and robust human compatibility, the system incorporates human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase for converting nitroglycerin into nitric oxide, which then activates soluble guanylate cyclase to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate, followed by protein kinase G to amplify the signal and to trigger target gene expression. In a proof-of-concept study, human cells expressing the nitroglycerin-responsive system were encapsulated and implanted subcutaneously in obese mice with type 2 diabetes. Transdermal nitroglycerin patches applied over the implant enabled the controlled and reversible production of glucagon-like peptide-1 throughout the 35-day experimental period, effectively restoring blood glucose levels in these mice without affecting heart rate or blood pressure. The approach may facilitate the development of safe, convenient and responsive implantable devices for the sustained delivery of biopharmaceuticals for the management of chronic diseases.",

Thanks to the advantage of no background fluorescence interference, the upconversion luminescence allows for reliable analysis of target molecules in complicated samples. Here, through screening of 20 natural amino acids, it is discovered that the photooxidation of methionine exhibited the fastest recovery rate of triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) luminescence via oxygen consumption, which is 400-fold faster compared to the well-known photooxidation of oleic acid. Furthermore, oxygen-resistant, small-size, red-to-blue TTA-UC nanoparticles with a record upconversion efficiency (7.2%, normalized to 100%) are prepared using hydrophobic butyl methionine as an oxygen scavenger. Surface negatively charged TTA-UC nanoparticles are able to selectively enrich positively charged paraquat on their surface. Accordingly, a photoinduced electron transfer process occurred between the triplet excited state of the photosensitizer and the electron-deficient paraquat, quenching the upconversion luminescence. Relying on this principle, TTA-UC-based paraquat sensing is achieved with a fast response (less than 1 s), high selectivity, and a low limit of detection (1.54 µg mL-1). Further, the TTA-UC nanoparticles are utilized to implement paraquat analysis in lake water without sample pretreatment.",

Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (Phlpp1) regulates protein kinase C (PKC) and other proteins in the control of bone mass. Germline Phlpp1 deficiency reduces bone volume, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we found that conditional Phlpp1 deletion in murine osteoclasts increases their numbers, but also enhances bone mass. Despite elevating osteoclasts, Phlpp1 deficiency did not increase serum markers of bone resorption, but elevated serum markers of bone formation. These results suggest that Phlpp1 suppresses osteoclast formation and production of paracrine factors controlling osteoblast activity. Phlpp1 deficiency elevated osteoclast numbers and size in ex vivo osteoclastogenesis assays, accompanied by enhanced expression of proto-oncogene C-Fms (C-Fms) and hyper-responsiveness to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in bone marrow macrophages. Although Phlpp1 deficiency increased TRAP+ cell numbers, it suppressed actin-ring formation and bone resorption in these assays. We observed that Phlpp1 deficiency increases activity of PKCζ, a PKC isoform controlling cell polarity, and that addition of a PKCζ pseudosubstrate restores osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption of Phlpp1-deficient osteoclasts. Moreover, Phlpp1 deficiency increased expression of the bone-coupling factor collagen triple helix repeat-containing 1 (Cthrc1). Conditioned growth medium derived from Phlpp1-deficient osteoclasts enhanced mineralization of ex vivo osteoblast cultures, an effect that was abrogated by Cthrc1 knockdown. In summary, Phlpp1 critically regulates osteoclast numbers, and Phlpp1 deficiency enhances bone mass despite higher osteoclast numbers because it apparently disrupts PKCζ activity, cell polarity, and bone resorption and increases secretion of bone-forming Cthrc1.",

In this study, experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), an animal model of human uveitis, was successfully induced with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) 651-670 and pertussis toxin. The immunized mice were treated with daily intragastric PA or vehicle from day 1 to 14. The results showed that PA could aggravate EAU activities and increase the proportion of T helper (Th) 17 cells as well as mRNA expression level of Il17a. There were no significant changes in Th1/Treg cell responses between these two groups. In vitro experiments showed that PA treatment could promote IRBP-specific Th17 cell response in association with increased proportion of Th17 cells as well as up-regulated expression of IL-17A. Proteomics showed an increased expression of stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) in PA-treated mice as compared to vehicle-treated mice. H-151, a potent antagonist of STING, attenuated the activities of EAU and Th17 cell responses induced by PA. Moreover, NF-κB/IL-6 signaling pathway was found to be downregulated after H-151 treatment. Collectively, PA could exacerbate EAU severity possibly through the activation of Th17 cells mediated by up-regulating STING.",

Methods: During this study, 43 patients participated, including 21 women and 22 men with a mean age of 66.8 years, who showed 63 areas of osteitis altogether. The diagnosis was made based on X-ray imaging and histopathological findings. All the subjects received pharmacological treatment with pentoxifylline 400 mg and tocopherol 400 IU. The study scheme consisted of initial observation and two follow-up examinations every 5-6 months. MRONJ severity, peripheral blood parameters, and CRP levels were evaluated.

Conclusions: Pentoxifylline and tocopherol therapy in MRONJ was effective in patients taking oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, in patients with osteoporosis, and undergoing oncological treatment. This treatment approach allows surgery to be avoided or significantly reduced. The good response to pharmacotherapy observed in patients with early stages of MRONJ shows an urgent need to monitor the patients treated with bisphosphonates carefully to diagnose MRONJ at the initial phase.",

            "source": "39929804: Targeting host proteins that are crucial for viral replication offers a promising antiviral strategy. We have designed and characterised antiviral PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) targeting the human protein cyclophilin A (CypA), a host cofactor for unrelated viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

We have designed and characterised antiviral PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) targeting the human protein cyclophilin A (CypA), a host cofactor for unrelated viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The PROTAC warheads are based on fully synthetic macrocycles derived from sanglifehrin A, which are structurally different from the classical Cyp inhibitor, cyclosporine A. Our Cyp-PROTACs decrease CypA levels in cell lines and primary human cells and have high specificity for CypA confirmed by proteomics experiments. Critically, CypA degradation facilitates improved antiviral activity against HIV-1 in primary human CD4+ T cells compared to the non-PROTAC parental inhibitor, at limiting inhibitor concentrations. Similarly, we observe antiviral activity against HCV replicon in a hepatoma cell line. We propose that CypA-targeting PROTACs inhibit viral replication potently and anticipate reduced evolution of viral resistance and broad efficacy against unrelated viruses. Furthermore, they provide powerful tools for probing cyclophilin biology.",

Heterologously expressed TWD1 does not exhibit cis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity and does not complement yeast FKBP12 mutants, suggesting that TWD1 acts indirectly via protein-protein interaction. Yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screens with TWD1 identified cDNA sequences that encode the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis multidrug-resistance-like ABC transporter AtPGP1. This interaction was verified in vitro. Mapping of protein interaction domains shows that AtPGP1 surprisingly binds to the N-terminus of TWD1 harboring the cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase-like domain and not to the tetratrico-peptide repeat domain, which has been shown to mediate protein-protein interaction. Unlike all other FKBPs, TWD1 is shown to be an integral membrane protein that colocalizes with its interacting partner AtPGP1 on the plasma membrane. TWD1 also interacts with AtPGP19 (AtMDR1), the closest homologue of AtPGP1. The single gene mutation twd1-1 and double atpgp1-1/atpgp19-1 (atmdr1-1) mutants exhibit similar phenotypes including epinastic growth, reduced inflorescence size, and reduced polar auxin transport, suggesting that a functional TWD1-AtPGP1/AtPGP19 complex is required for proper plant development.",
