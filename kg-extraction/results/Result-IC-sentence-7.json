Exosomes from 5-FU resistant CRC cells (HCT-15/FU) significantly enhanced the resistance to 5-FU and the malignant properties of HCT-15 cells. Double screening of miRNAs in CRC cell-exosomes and serum-exosomes from clinical CRC patients revealed that miR-224-5p was expressed at significantly lower levels in the 5-FU resistant type than in the 5-FU sensitive type. Moreover, the overall survival rates of 5-FU-resistant CRC patients were much lower than those of 5-FU-sensitive CRC patients. Furthermore, cellular miRNA sequencing (miR-Seq) and proteomic studies revealed that several miRNAs such as miR-224-5p, were significantly downregulated and that calcium-related proteins, including S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4), were upregulated in HCT-15/FU cells. An analysis of data from public databases revealed that patients with CRC with lower S100A4 expression had a better prognosis. In addition, miR-224-5p was shown to directly target S100A4. Functionally, in vitro and in vivo experiments verified that the downregulation of miR-224-5p promoted malignant properties and resistance to 5-FU in HCT-15 cells, whereas the upregulation of miR-224-5p in HCT-15/FU cells attenuated these effects. Notably, 5-FU combined with verapamil reversed 5-FU resistance in CRC by regulating the miR-224-5p/S100A4 pathway. Triptolide inhibited the malignant properties of HCT-15/FU cells by affecting the miR-224-5p/S100A4 axis. Overall, miR-224-5p is involved in CRC 5-FU resistance by regulating S100A4, and might serve as a molecular marker for the early prediction and intervention of 5-FU resistance in CRC patients in the clinic. Triptolide or 5-FU combined with a calcium antagonist could be used as a trial therapy for 5-FU resistant CRC patients.",

Exosomes from 5-FU resistant CRC cells (HCT-15/FU) significantly enhanced the resistance to 5-FU and the malignant properties of HCT-15 cells. Double screening of miRNAs in CRC cell-exosomes and serum-exosomes from clinical CRC patients revealed that miR-224-5p was expressed at significantly lower levels in the 5-FU resistant type than in the 5-FU sensitive type. Moreover, the overall survival rates of 5-FU-resistant CRC patients were much lower than those of 5-FU-sensitive CRC patients. Furthermore, cellular miRNA sequencing (miR-Seq) and proteomic studies revealed that several miRNAs such as miR-224-5p, were significantly downregulated and that calcium-related proteins, including S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4), were upregulated in HCT-15/FU cells. An analysis of data from public databases revealed that patients with CRC with lower S100A4 expression had a better prognosis. In addition, miR-224-5p was shown to directly target S100A4. Functionally, in vitro and in vivo experiments verified that the downregulation of miR-224-5p promoted malignant properties and resistance to 5-FU in HCT-15 cells, whereas the upregulation of miR-224-5p in HCT-15/FU cells attenuated these effects.

Although FIR was confirmed to possess antioxidative and anti-inflammatory attributes, the intricate cellular mechanisms through which FIR mitigates lead (Pb)-induced nephrotoxicity remain enigmatic. In this study, we investigated the effects of FIR on Pb-induced renal damage using in vitro and in vivo approaches. NRK52E rat renal cells exposed to Pb were subsequently treated with ceramic-generated FIR within the 9~14 Î¼m range. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) enabled quantitative Pb concentration assessment, while proteomic profiling unraveled intricate cellular responses. In vivo investigations used Wistar rats chronically exposed to lead acetate (PbAc) at 6 g/L in their drinking water for 15 weeks, with or without a concurrent FIR intervention. Our findings showed that FIR upregulated the voltage-gated calcium channel, voltage-dependent L type, alpha 1D subunit (CaV1.3), and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) (p &lt; 0.05), resulting in increased calcium influx (p &lt; 0.01), the promotion of mitochondrial activity, and heightened ATP production. Furthermore, the FIR intervention effectively suppressed ROS production, concurrently mitigating Pb-induced cellular death. Notably, rats subjected to FIR exhibited significantly reduced blood Pb levels (30 vs. 71 Î¼g/mL; p &lt; 0.01), attenuated Pb-induced glomerulosclerosis, and enhanced Pb excretion compared to the controls.

            "source": "37007007: Objective: Based on the 4D label-free phosphoproteomic technique, we examined the differences in cognitive function and hippocampal phosphorylated protein expression in high-fat diet-induced obese mice after the intervention of semaglutide and empagliflozin, as well as the effects of both on protein activity and function in obese mice's hippocampal tissues and the signaling pathways involved. Methods: Thirty-two C57BL/6JC male mice were assigned to two groups randomly: A control group (group C, 10% of energy is from fat, n = 8) and a high-fat diet group (group H, 60% of energy is from fat, n = 24). The high-fat diet-induced obese mice were screened after 12Â weeks of feeding based on the criterion that the bodyweight of mice in fat rich diet group was greater than or equal to 20% of the average body weight of the mice in the blank control group. Group H separate into group H (n = 8), group Semaglutide (group S, n = 8), and group empagliflozin (group E, n = 8). For a total of 12Â weeks, group S received 30Â nmol/kg/d bodyweight of semaglutide intraperitoneally, group E received 10Â mg/kg/d bodyweight of empagliflozin via gavage, and groups C and H received equal amounts of saline by intraperitoneal injection and gavage. At the end of treatment, the mice were appraised for cognitive function employing the Morris water maze (MWM), and serum fasting glucose, lipids, and inflammatory parameters were measured. The 4D label-free phosphoproteomics method was employed to screen the differential phosphoproteins and loci in hippocampal tissues of mice in different treatment groups, and bioinformatics was used to analyze the biological processes, signaling pathways, and related protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of these differentially phosphorylated proteins. Results: In comparison to normal controls, The escape latency of obese mice induced by high-fat diet was prolonged, the percentage of swimming time in the target quadrant was reduced, and the number of times of crossing the platform was reduced, whereas semaglutide and empagliflozin treatment reduced escape latency, increase the percentage of swim time in the target quadrant and increase the frequency of passing through the platform area, although there is little difference in the effect of the two drugs. The phosphoproteomic results showed 20,493 unique phosphorylated peptides, representing 21,239 phosphorylation sites and 4,290 phosphorylated proteins. Further analysis revealed that the proteins corresponding to these differentially phosphorylated sites are jointly distributed in signaling pathways such as dopaminergic synapses and axon guidance, and are involved in biological processes such as neuronal projection development, synaptic plasticity, and axonogenesis. Notably, the key factors voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1D (CACNA1D), voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1A (CACNA1A), and voltage-dependent N-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1B (CACNA1B) were all found to be involved in the dopaminergic synapse pathway, and their expression was upregulated by semaglutide and empagliflozin. Conclusion: We found for the first time that a high-fat diet decreased CACNA1D, CACNA1A, and CACNA1B protein serine phosphorylation, which may affect neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function in mice. Notably, semaglutide and empagliflozin increased the phosphorylation of these proteins. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37007007/",

Here we showed that CACNA1E was also mutated in 207 (12.8%) of the 1616 patients with NSCLC in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. At mRNA and protein levels, CACNA1E was elevated in tumor tissues compared to counterpart non-tumoral lung tissues in NSCLCs of the public datasets and our settings, and its expression level was inversely associated with clinical outcome of the patients. Overexpression of wild type (WT) or A275S or R249G mutant CACNA1E transcripts promoted NSCLC cell proliferation with activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, whereas knockdown of this gene exerted inhibitory effects on NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. CACNA1E increased current density and Ca2+ entrance, whereas calcium channel blockers inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation. These data indicate that CACNA1E is required for NSCLC cell proliferation, and blockade of this oncoprotein may have therapeutic potentials for this deadly disease.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of lomerizine, a prophylactic drug for migraine, on H(2)O(2)-induced cell death of hippocampal neurons. Cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration was measured using fura-2 as a Ca(2+) indicator. Cell death was estimated by trypan blue exclusion. In rat-cultured hippocampal neurons, the addition of H(2)O(2) induced biphasic Ca(2+) elevations and cell death. The H(2)O(2)-induced biphasic Ca(2+) elevations and cell death only occurred when extracellular Ca(2+) was present. The biphasic Ca(2+) elevation was mediated by Ca(2+) influx through the plasma membrane, but not Ca(2+) release from the intracellular Ca(2+) store. Both the early and late phases of H(2)O(2)-induced Ca(2+) influx were reduced by either a T- or L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (VDCC) blocker, lomerizine. In fact, L-type VDCC (Î±(1C) subunit) and T-type VDCC (Î±(1G) subunit) mRNA were expressed in rat hippocampal neurons. Although an L-type VDCC blocker, nifedipine, partly suppressed the late phase of Ca(2+) influx in response to H(2)O(2), a T-type VDCC blocker, mibefradil, reduced both phases of Ca(2+) influx. Moreover, lomerizine and mibefradil strongly reduced H(2)O(2)-induced cell death, and nifedipine weakly reduced it. These findings suggest that the inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced Ca(2+) influx through T-type VDCC seems to be important in the protective effect of lomerizine against oxidative stress.

Recently, the authors completed large-scale genetic and gene expression analyses in a segregating inbred mouse cross and identified candidate causal genes that regulate the mammalian sleep-wake cycle, across multiple traits including total sleep time, amounts of rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM, sleep bout duration, and sleep fragmentation. Here the authors describe a novel approach toward validating candidate causal genes, while also identifying potential targets for sleep-related indications. Select small-molecule antagonists and agonists were used to interrogate candidate causal gene function in rodent sleep polysomnography assays to determine impact on overall sleep architecture and to evaluate alignment with associated sleep-wake traits. Significant effects on sleep architecture were observed in validation studies using compounds targeting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 subunit (Chrm3) (wake promotion), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit (Chrna4) (wake promotion), dopamine receptor D5 subunit (Drd5) (sleep induction), serotonin 1D receptor (Htr1d) (altered REM fragmentation), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp1r) (light sleep promotion and reduction of deep sleep), and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, T type, alpha 1I subunit (Cacna1i) (increased bout duration of slow wave sleep). Taken together, these results show the complexity of genetic components that regulate sleep-wake traits and highlight the importance of evaluating this complex behavior at a systems level.

Recently, the authors completed large-scale genetic and gene expression analyses in a segregating inbred mouse cross and identified candidate causal genes that regulate the mammalian sleep-wake cycle, across multiple traits including total sleep time, amounts of rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM, sleep bout duration, and sleep fragmentation. Here the authors describe a novel approach toward validating candidate causal genes, while also identifying potential targets for sleep-related indications. Select small-molecule antagonists and agonists were used to interrogate candidate causal gene function in rodent sleep polysomnography assays to determine impact on overall sleep architecture and to evaluate alignment with associated sleep-wake traits. Significant effects on sleep architecture were observed in validation studies using compounds targeting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 subunit (Chrm3) (wake promotion), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit (Chrna4) (wake promotion), dopamine receptor D5 subunit (Drd5) (sleep induction), serotonin 1D receptor (Htr1d) (altered REM fragmentation), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp1r) (light sleep promotion and reduction of deep sleep), and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, T type, alpha 1I subunit (Cacna1i) (increased bout duration of slow wave sleep). Taken together, these results show the complexity of genetic components that regulate sleep-wake traits and highlight the importance of evaluating this complex behavior at a systems level. Pharmacological validation of genetically identified putative targets provides a rapid alternative to generating knock out or transgenic animal models, and may ultimately lead towards new therapeutic opportunities.",

Subsequent assays revealed that the interaction of GÎ²2 subunit was specific to the Cav3.3 C-terminus.

Proteomics studies suggest that PA alters levels of many proteins, some of which may function as molecules in the biological processes underlying frailty. However, these studies have focused on structured exercise programs or cross-sectional PA-protein associations. Therefore, the effects of long-term PA on frailty-associated proteins remain unknown. Among 14,898 middle-aged adults, we emulated a target trial that assigned individuals to either (i) achieve and maintain the recommended PA level (â¥150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]) through 6 (Â±0.3) years of follow-up or (ii) follow a natural course strategy, where all individuals engage in various amounts of habitual MVPA. We estimated the effects of long-term adherence to recommended MVPA versus the natural course strategy on 45 previously identified frailty-associated proteins (log 2 transformed and standardized) at the end of the follow-up using inverse probability of weighting (IPW) and iterative conditional expectations (ICE). We found that long-term adherence to recommended MVPA improved the population levels of many frailty-associated proteins (ranged from 0.04 to 0.11 standard deviation); the greatest benefits were seen in proteins involved in the nervous system (e.g., voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-3 [CACNA2D3], contactin-1 [CNTN1], neural cell adhesion molecule 1 [NCAM1], and transmembrane protein 132D [TMEM132D]) and inflammation (e.g., high-temperature requirement serine protease A1 [HTRA1] and C-reactive protein [CRP]). Our findings suggest long-term engagement in adequate habitual PA may reduce frailty risk through specific nervous systems and inflammatory proteins.",

We found that long-term adherence to recommended MVPA improved the population levels of many frailty-associated proteins (ranged from 0.04 to 0.11 standard deviation); the greatest benefits were seen in proteins involved in the nervous system (e.g., voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-3 [CACNA2D3], contactin-1 [CNTN1], neural cell adhesion molecule 1 [NCAM1], and transmembrane protein 132D [TMEM132D]) and inflammation (e.g., high-temperature requirement serine protease A1 [HTRA1] and C-reactive protein [CRP]).

In recent years, channel-independent functions of these subunits, such as involvement in synapse formation, have been identified. In the central nervous system, Î±âÎ´ isoforms 1, 2, and 3 are strongly expressed, regulating glutamatergic synapse formation by a presynaptic mechanism. Although the Î±âÎ´-4 isoform is predominantly found in the retina with very little expression in the brain, it was recently linked to brain functions. In contrast, Cachd1, a novel Î±âÎ´-like protein, shows strong expression in brain, but its function in neurons is not yet known. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the presynaptic functions of Î±âÎ´-4 and Cachd1 by expressing individual proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons. Both Î±âÎ´-4 and Cachd1 are expressed in the presynaptic membrane and could rescue a severe synaptic defect present in triple knockout/knockdown neurons that lacked the Î±âÎ´-1-3 isoforms (Î±âÎ´ TKO/KD). This observation suggests that presynaptic localization and the regulation of synapse formation in glutamatergic neurons is a general feature of Î±âÎ´ proteins. In contrast to this redundant presynaptic function, Î±âÎ´-4 and Cachd1 differentially regulate the abundance of presynaptic calcium channels and the amplitude of presynaptic calcium transients. These functional differences may be caused by subtle isoform-specific differences in Î±â-Î±âÎ´ protein-protein interactions, as revealed by structural homology modelling. Taken together, our study identifies both Î±âÎ´-4 and Cachd1 as presynaptic regulators of synapse formation, differentiation, and calcium channel functions that can at least partially compensate for the loss of Î±âÎ´-1-3. Moreover, we show that regulating glutamatergic synapse formation and differentiation is a critical and surprisingly redundant function of Î±âÎ´ and Cachd1.",

Mechanistically, a short S4-S5 linker is coupled with the constrict sites to mediate voltage transducing in a non-domain-swapped configuration, resulting transitions for constrict sites of F464 and Q472 from gating to open state stabilizing for voltage energy transduction. Meanwhile, an additional potassium ion occupied at positions S6 confers the delayed rectifier property and Cole-Moore effects. These results provide insight into voltage transducing and potassium current across membrane, and shed light on the long-sought Cole-Moore effects.",

Muscle afferent sensitization contributes to the genesis of the exaggerated EPR in CHF. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying muscle afferent sensitization in CHF remain unclear. Considering that voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels critically regulate afferent neuronal excitability, we examined the potential role of Kv channels in mediating the sensitized EPR in male rats with CHF. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting experiments demonstrate that both mRNA and protein expressions of multiple Kv channel isoforms (Kv1.4, Kv3.4, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3) were downregulated in lumbar dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of CHF rats compared with sham rats. Immunofluorescence data demonstrate significant decreased Kv channel staining in both NF200-positive and IB4-positive lumbar DRG neurons in CHF rats compared with sham rats. Data from patch-clamp experiments demonstrate that the total Kv current, especially I<sub>A</sub>, was dramatically decreased in medium-sized IB4-negative muscle afferent neurons (a subpopulation containing mostly AÎ´ neurons) from CHF rats compared with sham rats, indicating a potential functional loss of Kv channels in muscle afferent AÎ´ neurons. In in vivo experiments, adenoviral overexpression of Kv4.3 in lumbar DRGs for 1 wk attenuated the exaggerated EPR induced by muscle static contraction and the mechanoreflex by passive stretch without affecting the blunted cardiovascular response to hindlimb arterial injection of capsaicin in CHF rats.

The formulations with HPMC K4M showed slower drug release due to a strong hydro layer. Citric acid content increased drug release, suggesting modulation of drug release kinetics. Kinetic modeling revealed that some of the formulations exhibited zero-order release kinetics, which means that the drug is released at a constant rate to maintain a steady level of the drug in the body. This project aims to improve the therapeutic effect of Class I Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS I) drug ondansetron by using a stomach-retaining, floating drug delivery system. Promising results are indicative of better bioavailability and sustained therapeutic doses. Findings may influence the development of delivery methods for similar substances facing gastrointestinal absorption challenges.",

A new floating drug delivery for Ondansetron was designed and evaluated. Pre-formulation studies included the assessment of powder flow properties and drug-excipient compatibility. In-vitro release studies and a buoyancy test were performed to characterize the performance of the system. The study evaluated the properties of Ondansetron tablets. The optimized batches had compressibility index values ranging from 7.272â¯% to 25â¯%, with percentage weight fluctuation ranging from 0 to 1.05â¯%.

Blocking ATP from binding and activating P2X receptors with pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS) prevented both glutamate- and ATP-triggered contractions, suggesting that ATP works downstream of glutamate. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two P2X receptor sequences, one of which groups with other vertebrate P2X receptors. Altogether, our results confirm that purinergic signalling by ATP is involved in coordinating contractions in the freshwater sponge.",
