The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway leads to the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway has been suggested to not only facilitate inflammatory responses and the production of type I interferons (IFN), but also activate other cellular processes, such as apoptosis. It has not been studied, however, whether cGAS-STING activation is involved in the apoptosis induced by statin treatment in human colorectal cancer cells. In this study, we reported that lovastatin impaired mitochondrial function, including the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduction of oxygen consumption, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity, and mtDNA abundance in human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. The mitochondrial dysfunction markedly induced ROS production in mitochondria, whereas the defect in mitochondria respiration or depletion of mitochondria eliminated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The ROS-induced oxidative DNA damage by lovastatin treatment was attenuated by mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (mitoQ). Upon DNA damage, mtDNA was released into the cytosol and bound to DNA sensor cGAS, thus activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to trigger a type I interferon response. This effect was not activated by nuclear DNA (nuDNA) or mitochondrial RNA, as the depletion of mitochondria compromised this effect, but not the knockdown of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1/melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (RIG-I/MDA5) adaptor or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Moreover, lovastatin-induced apoptosis was partly dependent on the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in HCT116 cells as the knockdown of cGAS or STING expression rescued cell viability and mitigated apoptosis. Similarly, the knockdown of cGAS or STING also attenuated the antitumor effect of lovastatin in the HCT116 xenograft model in vivo. Our findings suggest that lovastatin-induced apoptosis is at least partly mediated through the cGAS-STING signaling pathway by triggering mtDNA accumulation in the cytosol in human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells.",

TXNRD1's role in regulating tissue aging has been attributed to its enzymatic role in cellular redox regulation. Here, we show that TXNRD1 drives the SASP and inflammaging through the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) innate immune response pathway independently of its enzymatic activity. TXNRD1 localizes to cytoplasmic chromatin fragments and interacts with cGAS in a senescence-status-dependent manner, which is necessary for the SASP. TXNRD1 enhances the enzymatic activity of cGAS. TXNRD1 is required for both the tumor-promoting and immune surveillance functions of senescent cells, which are mediated by the SASP in vivo in mouse models. Treatment of aged mice with a TXNRD1 inhibitor that disrupts its interaction with cGAS, but not with an inhibitor of its enzymatic activity alone, downregulated markers of inflammaging in several tissues.

In this study, we report the discovery of ionic arginine-rich peptides to disrupt the pathogenic galectin-10 (gal-10) crystallization, where the aberrant deposition of gal-10 crystals in airways causes the activation of IL-1β-dependent inflammation and the stimulation of epithelial cells to produce TNF-α. Gal-10 crystals show susceptibility to pH changes and charged residue substitutions at the protein packing interfaces, manifesting the role of charge-charge attractions across protein-protein interaction interfaces in governing gal-10 crystallization. To dissolve the gal-10 crystal, the ionic peptides R9 and R12Y8 were identified to eliminate the interprotein charge-charge interactions. The efficacy of R12Y8 in mitigating the gal-10 crystallopathy in vivo was assessed in a crystal-induced lung inflammation mice model. The mice intratracheally administrated by R12Y8 exhibited a downregulated release of proinflammatory cytokines and reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs. Our study demonstrates that the pathogenic gal-10 crystallization is readily eliminated by R-rich peptides, which may display translational potentials for the treatment of gal-10 crystallopathy.",

However, although triglycerides need to be digested to free fatty acids to be recognized by fat-taste receptors such as GPR120, it remains unknown whether lipase activities exist in chicken oral tissues. To examine this question, we first cloned another fat-taste receptor candidate gene, CD36, from the chicken palate. Then, using RT-PCR, we determined that GPR120 and CD36 were broadly expressed in chicken oral and gastrointestinal tissues. Also by RT-PCR, we confirmed that several lipase genes were expressed in both oral and gastrointestinal tissues. Finally, we analyzed the lipase activities of oral tissues by using a fluorogenic triglyceride analog as a lipase substrate. We found there are functional lipases in oral tissues as well as in the stomach and pancreas.

Pretreatment with the nonspecific ROS scavenger PBN and the superoxide-selective scavenger TEMPOL significantly attenuated nicotine-induced hyperlocomotor activity without impairing motor function in nicotine-naïve rats on day 7. In addition, in intravenous nicotine self-administration study, TEMPOL significantly reduced nicotine-taking behavior without affecting food intake in nicotine-naïve rats. Furthermore, TEMPOL pretreatment prevented nicotine effects on stimulated DA release in the NAc, which was associated with nicotine-induced behavioral changes. Taken together, these findings suggest that increased ROS production in the NAc contributes to the neuropharmacological properties of nicotine.",

However, its effects have not yet been studied in ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to assess the protective effects of LA in UC and investigate its potential mechanisms of action. Our findings indicated that LA effectively mitigated oxidative stress in mice with colitis by increasing the production of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), while reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (p<0.05 for all). In NCM460 cells, LA inhibited the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increase in ROS and preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that LA decreased the production of inflammatory markers (p<0.05). Additionally, LA upregulated intestinal mucosal proteins, contributing to mucosal barrier repair. Mechanistically, LA activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling pathway, increasing the expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) while inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation (p<0.05). Notably, the inhibition of Nrf2 reversed the protective effects of LA against colitis. Molecular docking analyses support a strong interaction between Nrf2 and LA.

This unique arrangement results in a microsecond long metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited state relative to the nanosecond intraligand excited state of [A5]. Upon light irradiation at 560 nm, [A9] generates active 1O<sub>2</sub> to oxidize glutathione (GSH) into poorly coordinating GSSG in the cytoplasm and finally promotes subcellular delivery of HCGCs to mitochondria. Moreover, GSH further triggers consecutive release of active [AuPPh<sub>3</sub>]+ ions to inhibit cytoplasmic glutathione peroxidase GPX4 and mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase TrxR2, which collectively result in accelerated ferroptosis of human bladder cancer EJ cells and show excellent antitumor performance in mouse bladder tumor models.",

Many of these diseases coincide with each other and can even influence the onset of additional comorbidities. Sarcopenic obesity is described as age-related loss of muscle mass that concurs with excessive weight gain and tends to increase the risk of comorbidity development, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though the exact link between sarcopenic obesity and AD is not known, this review explores the possibility that reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) throughout the body may serve as the underlying commonality. In AD, reductions in BDNF signalling through its receptor promote the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), which subsequently increases the production of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In the skeletal muscle, lower BDNF concentrations are linked to impaired muscle fibre repair and regeneration, increasing the likelihood of sarcopenia. Furthermore, the absence of BDNF impairs mitochondrial function, leading to insulin resistance and increased adiposity. BDNF concentration has a negative relationship with obesogenic markers in adipose tissue, and as such, lower concentrations of BDNF lead to weight gain. Collectively, current literature suggests that BDNF attenuates AD pathology while improving skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, whole-body insulin resistance and facilitating adipocyte browning.

PYGL knockdown inhibited cell invasion, proliferation, migration, and colony formation and enhanced apoptosis via modulation of Bcl-2, caspase-3, and Bax. Glycolysis was impaired in PYGL-knockdown cells, as indicated by increased glycogen levels and a reduced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, lactate levels, and PKM2 and LDHA expression. PYGL overexpression promoted glycolysis and cell viability, which was counteracted by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Hypoxia-induced PYGL expression was regulated by HIF1α, underscoring the interplay between the hypoxia and glycolysis pathways.",

Methods: Patients were categorized based on coronary CT angiography. Patients with a Segment Involvement Score > 5 were identified as CAD patients. Individuals with a Segment Involvement Score < 5 were considered control subjects. The characterization of EVs and analysis of the plasma concentration of growth differentiation factor-15 were performed using multicolor or bead-based flow cytometry. The plasma protein levels of glycogen phosphorylase, muscle form, clusterin, and carboxypeptidase N subunit 1 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association of the biomarkers with the CAD outcome after accounting for established risk factors. The analysis was built in three steps: first, we included the basic clinical and laboratory variables (Model 1), then we integrated the plasma protein values (Model 2), and finally, we complemented it with the circulating EV pattern (Model 3). To assess the discrimination value of the models, an area under (AUC) the receiver operating curve was calculated and compared across the three models. Results: The area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.68, 0.77, and 0.84 in Models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The variables with the greatest impact on the AUC values were hemoglobin (0.2 (0.16-0.26)) in Model 1, carboxypeptidase N subunit 1 (0.12 (0.09-0.14)) in Model 2, and circulating CD41+/CD61+ EVs (0.31 (0.15-0.5)) in Model 3. A correlation analysis showed a significant impact of circulating CD41+/CD61+ platelet-derived EVs (p = 0.03, r = -0.4176) in Model 3. Conclusions: Based on our results, the circulating EV profile can be used as a supportive biomarker, along with the conventional laboratory markers of CAD, and it enables a more sensitive, non-invasive diagnostic analysis of CAD.",

Molecular species of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine and oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylethanolamine could be divided into three groups according to their degradation rate and sensitivity to PAF-AH/Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor darapladib.

Uncharacterized is the role of cPLA2 in HKC activation by bacterial infection. This work aimed to determine the function and mechanism of cPLA2 in gram-negative bacteria (GNB)-induced HKC activation. In this study, we found that Escherichia coli (E. coli)-induced activation of HKCs led to a rise in cPLA2 mRNA and protein expression, where the ERK and NF-κB pathways were concurrently triggered. Luciferase activity of cPLA2' promoters, PLA2G4A promoters, was enhanced with the stimulation of E. coli or co-transfection with STAT3 or RelB in HKCs.

The E. coli-ERK-STAT3 and E. coli-non-canonical NF-κB-RelB signaling axes were then identified using pathway inhibitors and transcription factors in the rescue experiments during E. coli-induced HKC activation. In conclusion, we discovered that cPLA2 is necessary for E. coli-induced HKC activation, and the underlying mechanism could be the transcriptional regulation of STAT3 and RelB on the PLA2G4A promoter following the ERK and non-canonical NF-κB signaling activation, implying that the regulation of cPLA2 expression via the E. coli-ERK/non-canonical NF-κB-STAT3/RelB signaling axis could be effective for controlling GNB-induced HKC activation in cirrhotic patients.",

In this study, we found that Escherichia coli (E. coli)-induced activation of HKCs led to a rise in cPLA2 mRNA and protein expression, where the ERK and NF-κB pathways were concurrently triggered. Luciferase activity of cPLA2' promoters, PLA2G4A promoters, was enhanced with the stimulation of E. coli or co-transfection with STAT3 or RelB in HKCs. E. coli massively boosted the binding activity of STAT3 and RelB to the specific regions of the PLA2G4A promoter as measured by ChIP-qPCR. The E. coli-ERK-STAT3 and E. coli-non-canonical NF-κB-RelB signaling axes were then identified using pathway inhibitors and transcription factors in the rescue experiments during E. coli-induced HKC activation. In conclusion, we discovered that cPLA2 is necessary for E. coli-induced HKC activation, and the underlying mechanism could be the transcriptional regulation of STAT3 and RelB on the PLA2G4A promoter following the ERK and non-canonical NF-κB signaling activation, implying that the regulation of cPLA2 expression via the E. coli-ERK/non-canonical NF-κB-STAT3/RelB signaling axis could be effective for controlling GNB-induced HKC activation in cirrhotic patients.",

Activation of human Kupffer cells (HKCs) from livers is essential for human innate immunity. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) plays a crucial role in the control and balance of innate immune and inflammatory reactions. Uncharacterized is the role of cPLA2 in HKC activation by bacterial infection. This work aimed to determine the function and mechanism of cPLA2 in gram-negative bacteria (GNB)-induced HKC activation. In this study, we found that Escherichia coli (E. coli)-induced activation of HKCs led to a rise in cPLA2 mRNA and protein expression, where the ERK and NF-κB pathways were concurrently triggered. Luciferase activity of cPLA2' promoters, PLA2G4A promoters, was enhanced with the stimulation of E. coli or co-transfection with STAT3 or RelB in HKCs. E. coli massively boosted the binding activity of STAT3 and RelB to the specific regions of the PLA2G4A promoter as measured by ChIP-qPCR. The E. coli-ERK-STAT3 and E. coli-non-canonical NF-κB-RelB signaling axes were then identified using pathway inhibitors and transcription factors in the rescue experiments during E. coli-induced HKC activation. In conclusion, we discovered that cPLA2 is necessary for E. coli-induced HKC activation, and the underlying mechanism could be the transcriptional regulation of STAT3 and RelB on the PLA2G4A promoter following the ERK and non-canonical NF-κB signaling activation, implying that the regulation of cPLA2 expression via the E. coli-ERK/non-canonical NF-κB-STAT3/RelB signaling axis could be effective for controlling GNB-induced HKC activation in cirrhotic patients.",

            "source": "The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfamily has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to the multiple physiological and pathological functions exerted by its members. Up to date, the knowledge about the biological role of PLA2XIIA subfamily members remains limited. In this study, a new member of PLA2XIIA subfamily, LcPLA2XIIA, was characterized in large yellow croaker. Different from most members of the PLA2 superfamily with positive charge, LcPLA2XIIA encodes an anionic protein, which is similar to other members of PLA2XIIA subfamily. LcPLA2XIIA is highly expressed in the intestine, and afterwards, it is up-regulated after with Pseudomonas plecoglossicida or Staphylococcus aureus. LcPLA2XIIA exhibits strong inhibitory activity against these two bacteria. The results indicate that LcPLA2XIIA plays an important role in the antimicrobial immune responses of large yellow croaker. LcPLA2XIIA displays strong binding activity to all the tested bacteria. It specifically interacts with LTA, a unique component on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria. It also significantly promotes bacterial agglutination in the presence of Ca2+. These findings reveal that the binding and agglutinating abilities of LcPLA2XIIA to bacteria contribute greatly to its antibacterial activity. In addition, LcPLA2XIIA significantly inhibits the proliferation of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus instead of recombinant human adenovirus type 5. It also suppresses the growth of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis, but it has no obvious inhibitory effect on the growth of epithelioma papulosum cyprinid cells. This study provides new insights into the antibacterial activity, and the mechanism of LcPLA2XIIA in large yellow croaker, and antiviral and antitumor functions of PLA2XIIA subfamily members.",

The results of real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses indicated that HEP upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), subsequently upregulated the expression of liver fatty acid oxidation-related genes (lipoprotein lipase (LPL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT-1a), and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1)) and downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1), and fatty acid synthase (FASN)), thereby ameliorating lipid metabolism disorders. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that HEP exerted protective effects on lipid metabolism disorders by activating the PPARα pathway, indicating its potential as a dietary supplement for the prevention and amelioration of obesity.",

Moreover, the mechanisms of NGF in the acute and recovery phases, along with the strategies to enhance its therapeutic effects using delivery systems (such as intranasal administration, nanovesicles, and gene therapy) were also summarized. Although NGF shows great potential for clinical application, its delivery efficiency and long-term safety still need more research and improvements. Future research should focus on exploring the specific action mechanism of NGF, optimizing the delivery strategy, and evaluating its long-term efficacy and safety to facilitate its clinical transformation in cerebral ischemic stroke.",

As is the case for all AdoCbl-dependent isomerases, the catalytic cycle of EAL is initiated by homolytic cleavage of the cofactor's Co-C bond, producing CoIIcobalamin (CoIICbl) and an adenosyl radical that serves to abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate. Remarkably, in the presence of substrate, the rate of Co-C bond homolysis of enzyme-bound AdoCbl is increased by 12 orders of magnitude. For Class I AdoCbl-dependent isomerases, an important contribution to this rate acceleration stems from a stabilization of the CoIICbl posthomolysis product by the axially coordinated histidine residue that displaces the pendant base from the Co ion upon AdoCbl binding to these enzymes. However, EAL and other Class II isomerases bind AdoCbl in the so-called base-on conformation and must therefore employ a different mechanism of Co-C bond activation. In the present study, we have used a combined spectroscopic and computational approach to probe the conformational changes and enzyme/cofactor/substrate interactions that contribute to the rate acceleration of Co-C bond homolysis in EAL. Spectroscopic data of AdoCbl and CoIICbl show minimal perturbations upon cofactor binding to EAL in both the absence and presence of substrate. Structural models of free and EAL-bound AdoCbl were constructed using molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computations. By carrying out relaxed potential energy scans for Co-C bond cleavage of free and EAL-bound AdoCbl, we identified key cofactor/enzyme interactions that contribute to the Co-C bond activation by EAL and obtained Co-C bond dissociation energies that agree well with published experimental data.",

For Class I AdoCbl-dependent isomerases, an important contribution to this rate acceleration stems from a stabilization of the CoIICbl posthomolysis product by the axially coordinated histidine residue that displaces the pendant base from the Co ion upon AdoCbl binding to these enzymes. However, EAL and other Class II isomerases bind AdoCbl in the so-called base-on conformation and must therefore employ a different mechanism of Co-C bond activation. In the present study, we have used a combined spectroscopic and computational approach to probe the conformational changes and enzyme/cofactor/substrate interactions that contribute to the rate acceleration of Co-C bond homolysis in EAL. Spectroscopic data of AdoCbl and CoIICbl show minimal perturbations upon cofactor binding to EAL in both the absence and presence of substrate. Structural models of free and EAL-bound AdoCbl were constructed using molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computations. By carrying out relaxed potential energy scans for Co-C bond cleavage of free and EAL-bound AdoCbl, we identified key cofactor/enzyme interactions that contribute to the Co-C bond activation by EAL and obtained Co-C bond dissociation energies that agree well with published experimental data.",
