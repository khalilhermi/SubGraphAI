The large biodiversity of micCYPs leads to the idea that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving micCYPs are not limited to classical redox partners. This review aims to perform a systems biology analysis of the complete set of PPIs for all 33 micCYPs studied, as well as to examine the subinteractome of each micCYP. We have retrieved 287 PPIs from interactomic databases, involving 246 unique protein interactors that share a similar profile of subcellular localization with micCYPs. The number of protein interactors per micCYP unevenly varies from one to 47. Interactors of micCYPs are involved in cellular metabolism, signal transduction, cell-cell junctions, cytoskeleton organization, and intracellular or transmembrane transport. Notably, up to one-third of all interactors belong to the latter group, half of which consists of membrane transporters of compounds, metabolites, and ions (e.g., CACNA2D1, ORAI1, SCN3B, SLC7A2, SLC19A3, and SLC11A2). The CYP2C8 subinteractome is enriched with proteins involved in autophagy; CYP2S1- ERBB2 and EPH-Ephrin signaling; CYP3A4- glucuronidation. Proteins UBC, PGRMC1, and FANCG are the most frequent common interactors across various micCYPs. Nine and 12 interactors of micCYPs are involved in phosphorylation and ubiquitination, respectively; 20 interactors are 'moonlighting' proteins that are represented in the CYP3A4 subinteractome. Furthermore, micCYPs such as CYP2C9, 3A5, 2E1, 2A6, 4F2, and 4A11 may be involved in potentially binary interactions with other micCYPs. The functional implication of these CYP-CYP pairs is likely associated with modulation of their activity. Analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that some micCYP/interactor pairs exhibit tissue-, time-, and disease-specific gene expression patterns. Drugs that are metabolized by micCYPs in some cases can influence the expression of corresponding interactors at the gene or protein levels. These findings suggest that micCYPs may play roles in functions beyond their monooxygenase activity, as indicated by the spectrum of PPIs analyzed.",

We observed slower rates of retene metabolism compared with phenanthrene also in multiple phases.

This ecological risk has attracted the attention of many scholars, but it is not comprehensive enough. Thus, the adverse effects of MT on zebrafish (Danio rerio) were comprehensively evaluated from gonadal histology, as well as the mRNA expression levels of 47 genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, germ cell differentiation, sex determination, and hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Adult zebrafish with a female/male ratio of 5:7 were exposed to a solvent control (0.001% dimethyl sulfoxide) and three measured concentrations of MT (5, 51 and 583 ng/L) for 50 days. The results showed that MT had no significant histological effects on the ovaries of females, but the frequency of late-mature oocytes (LMO) showed a downward trend, indicating that MT could induce ovarian suppression to a certain extent. The transcriptional expression of activating transcription factor 4b1 (atf4b1), activating transcription factor 4b2 (atf4b2), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta 1 (camk2d1), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta 2 (camk2d2) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 2 (camk2n2) genes in the brain of females increased significantly at all treatment groups of MT, and the mRNA expression of forkhead box L2a (foxl2) and ovarian cytochrome P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a) genes in the ovaries were down-regulated by 5 and 583 ng/L group, which would translate into inhibition of oocyte development. As compared to females, MT had relatively little effects on the reproductive system of males, and only the transcriptional alterations of synaptonemal complex protein 3 (sycp3) and 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (cyp17) genes were observed in the testes, not enough to affect testicular histology. In addition, MT at all treatments strongly increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) transcript in the brain of females, as well as deiodinase 2 (dio2) transcript in the brain of males. The paired box protein 8 (pax8) gene was significantly decreased at 51 or 583 ng/L of MT in both female and male brains. The above results suggest that MT can pose potential adverse effects on the reproductive and thyroid endocrine system of fish.",

Fecal microbiota transplantation mirrored the effect of BMS-1 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiotoxicity, while macrophage depletion and neutralization of TNF-α and IL-1β greatly attenuated BMS-1-induced cardiotoxicity. Importantly, Prevotella loescheii recolonization and butyrate supplementation alleviated PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-related cardiotoxicity. Mechanistically, gut microbiota dysbiosis promoted M1-like polarization of colonic macrophages and the production of proinflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β through downregulation of PPARα-CYP4X1 axis.",

DNLA exhibits hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemia effects. However, to the best of our knowledge, the specific molecular mechanism by which DNLA can regulate lipid metabolism remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of DNLA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells and its potential mechanism. HepG2 cells were treated with LPS with or without different concentrations of DNLA (0, 0.035, 0.35 and 3.5 µg/ml) for 48 h. Cell viability was then detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanideperchlorate-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake assay was used to examine LDL uptake. In addition, possible mechanisms were explored using western blot analysis. The effect of the combination of DNLA with rosuvastatin calcium on the expression levels of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) was examined. The results indicated that LPS stimulation reduced the uptake of LDL by HepG2 cells, decreased the intracellular LDLR content, and increased the expression levels of inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL) and liver X receptor (LXR)α. DNLA intervention reversed all of the aforementioned LPS-induced effects in HepG2 cells. Additional mechanistic experiments revealed that DNLA exerted its effects mainly by regulating the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway. It was shown that DNLA also reduced the expression levels of PCSK9, sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α. In addition, DNLA decreased the expression levels of PCSK9 in rosuvastatin calcium-induced HepG2 cells. Notably, DNLA was able to decrease 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and increase cytochrome p450 7A1 expression at the protein level, which are rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. Collectively, these data suggested that DNLA could enhance LDL uptake of HepG2 cells by increasing LDLR expression through the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway to alleviate the effects induced by LPS, suggesting the potential benefit of DNLA in improving lipid metabolism disorders.",

Collectively, these data suggested that DNLA could enhance LDL uptake of HepG2 cells by increasing LDLR expression through the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway to alleviate the effects induced by LPS, suggesting the potential benefit of DNLA in improving lipid metabolism disorders.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of DNLA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells and its potential mechanism. HepG2 cells were treated with LPS with or without different concentrations of DNLA (0, 0.035, 0.35 and 3.5 µg/ml) for 48 h. Cell viability was then detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We quantified the age-dependent differences in the abundances of hepatic CYP enzymes using a large set of viable pediatric and adult hepatocytes using quantitative global proteomics. We report for the first time the ontogeny in the abundance of CYP enzymes in human hepatocytes, especially, orphan CYPs 20A1, 27A1, 51A1, 7B1, and 8B1 and CYP4 subfamily of enzymes.

The results, when combined with spectroscopic and functional analyses of HCCS and variants, provide insights into the structural basis for heme binding, apocyt c binding, covalent attachment, and release of the holocyt c product. Results from in vitro reconstitution of purified human HCCS using cyt c and cyt c<sub>1</sub> peptides as acceptors are consistent with the structural modeling of substrate binding. Reconstitution of HCCS and cyt c<sub>1</sub> provides an approach to studying cyt c<sub>1</sub> assembly, which has been refractile to recombinant in vivo reconstitution (unlike HCCS and cyt c). We propose a structural basis for release of the holocyt c product from HCCS based on in vitro studies and on cryoEM structures of the bacterial cyt c synthase (CcsBA) active site.

Discovery of objective biomarkers to aid concussion diagnosis is critical to protecting athlete brain health.

A total of 11 concussed male athletes were enrolled at our academic Sport Medicine Concussion Clinic, as well as 24 sex-, age- and activity-matched healthy control subjects.

Combining three of the protein biomarkers (ATOX1, SPARC and NT5C3A), produced an AUC of 0.98 for concussion diagnoses (P < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). Despite a paucity of studies on these three identified proteins, the available evidence points to their roles in modulating tissue inflammation and regulating integrity of the cerebral microvasculature.

Most importantly, these efforts culminated with the discovery of TAK-831 (luvadaxistat), an orally available brain-penetrant DAAO inhibitor currently under clinical development, representing a true bench-to-bedside success in this field.",

Our recent research indicates that PINK1 functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by regulating cellular metabolism. Interestingly, PINK1 ablation activated the NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome, releasing IL1B (interleukin 1 beta). However, inhibiting the NLRP3-IL1B signaling pathway with an IL1R (interleukin 1 receptor) antagonist or NLRP3 inhibitor did not hinder colon tumor growth after PINK1 loss. To identify druggable targets in PINK1-deficient tumors, ribonucleic acid sequencing analysis was performed on colon tumors from pink1 knockout and wild-type mice. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis highlighted the enrichment of iron ion transmembrane transporter activity. Subsequent qualitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed an increase in mitochondrial iron transporters, including mitochondrial calcium uniporter, in PINK1-deficient colon tumor cells and tissues. Live-cell iron staining demonstrated elevated cellular and mitochondrial iron levels in PINK1-deficient cells. Clinically used drugs deferiprone and minocycline reduced mitochondrial iron and superoxide levels, resulting in decreased colon tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Manipulating the mitochondrial iron uptake protein MCU (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) also affected cell and xenograft tumor growth. This study suggests that therapies aimed at reducing mitochondrial iron levels may effectively inhibit colon tumor growth, particularly in patients with low PINK1 expression.",

Some of these events are initiated during S-phase, but they accelerate and conclude during mitosis. Here we describe SRBD1 as a histone and nucleic acid binding protein that prevents DNA damage in interphase cells, localizes to nascent DNA during replication and the chromosome scaffold in mitosis, and is required for chromosome segregation. SRBD1 inactivation causes micronuclei, chromatin bridges, and cell death. Inactivating SRBD1 immediately prior to mitotic entry causes anaphase failure, with a reduction in topoisomerase IIα localization to mitotic chromosomes and defects in properly condensing and decatenating chromosomes. In contrast, SRBD1 is not required to complete cell division after chromosomes are condensed. Strikingly, depleting condensin II reduces the severity of the anaphase defects in SRBD1-deficient cells by restoring topoisomerase IIα localization. Thus, SRBD1 is an essential genome maintenance protein required for mitotic chromosome organization and segregation.",

Designated as critically endangered, the plant is used in the treatments of bacterial infections, cancer, intestinal helminthiasis, tuberculosis, and viral infections. A methanol extract of the leaves was prepared from which 16 different compounds were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. An alkylated phenol, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, was the predominant compound. Acute toxicity test indicated that the plant extract was non-toxic even at the highest dosage tested, i.e., 2000 mg/kg body weight. The plant extract caused considerable prolongation of survival in mice transplanted with Dalton's lymphoma ascites, extending life by 33 %, with median survival time of 35.5 and average survival time of 22.83 days, and with a treatment to control ratio of 131.37 %. Reduction of body mass, lipid peroxidation, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine were seen in DLA-transplanted mice after treatment with the plant extract. On the other hand, glutathione level, glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase activity increased. Alkaline comet assay showed that the plant extract effectively induced DNA damage, producing a tail length of 11.89 μm and Olive moment of 2.36 at 250 mg/kg bwt, the most effective dosage. Molecular docking revealed high ligand binding ability of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol to chemokine receptor CXCR4, DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha, DNA topoisomerase 2-beta, histone deacetylases (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3), Janus kinase 1 and programmed cell death protein 1. The safety and anticancer activity in the present study substantiate the therapeutic importance of I. khasiana as acclaimed in the Mizo traditional medicine.

Designated as critically endangered, the plant is used in the treatments of bacterial infections, cancer, intestinal helminthiasis, tuberculosis, and viral infections. A methanol extract of the leaves was prepared from which 16 different compounds were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. An alkylated phenol, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, was the predominant compound. Acute toxicity test indicated that the plant extract was non-toxic even at the highest dosage tested, i.e., 2000 mg/kg body weight. The plant extract caused considerable prolongation of survival in mice transplanted with Dalton's lymphoma ascites, extending life by 33 %, with median survival time of 35.5 and average survival time of 22.83 days, and with a treatment to control ratio of 131.37 %. Reduction of body mass, lipid peroxidation, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine were seen in DLA-transplanted mice after treatment with the plant extract. On the other hand, glutathione level, glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase activity increased. Alkaline comet assay showed that the plant extract effectively induced DNA damage, producing a tail length of 11.89 μm and Olive moment of 2.36 at 250 mg/kg bwt, the most effective dosage.

Mitoxantrone binds to DNA via both stacking interactions with DNA bases and hydrogen bonding with the sugar-phosphate backbone.

In this study, mitoxantrone-mediated inhibition of APE1 at THF sites was shown to be consistent with preferential binding to, and thermal stabilization of DNA containing a THF site as compared to non-damaged DNA. Investigations into the properties of mitoxantrone at AP and 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde sites demonstrated that in addition to being a potent inhibitor of APE1 at these biologically-relevant substrates (∼ 0.5 μM IC<sub>50</sub> on AP site-containing DNA), mitoxantrone also incised AP site-containing DNA by catalyzing β- and β/δ-elimination reactions. The efficiency of these reactions to generate the 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and 3' phosphate products was modulated by DNA structure. Although these cell-free reactions revealed that mitoxantrone can generate 3' phosphates, cells lacking polynucleotide kinase phosphatase did not show increased sensitivity to mitoxantrone treatment. Consistent with its ability to inhibit APE1 activity on DNAs containing either an AP site or a 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, combined exposures to clinically-relevant concentrations of mitoxantrone and a small molecule APE1 inhibitor revealed additive cytotoxicity.

            "source": "38039951: Mitoxantrone (1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis[2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)ethylamino]-anthracene-9,10-dione) is a clinically-relevant synthetic anthracenedione that functions as a topoisomerase II poison by trapping DNA double-strand break intermediates. Mitoxantrone binds to DNA via both stacking interactions with DNA bases and hydrogen bonding with the sugar-phosphate backbone. It has been shown that mitoxantrone inhibits apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 1 (APE1)-catalyzed incision of DNA containing a tetrahydrofuran (THF) moiety and more recently, that mitoxantrone forms Schiff base conjugates at AP sites in DNA. In this study, mitoxantrone-mediated inhibition of APE1 at THF sites was shown to be consistent with preferential binding to, and thermal stabilization of DNA containing a THF site as compared to non-damaged DNA. Investigations into the properties of mitoxantrone at AP and 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde sites demonstrated that in addition to being a potent inhibitor of APE1 at these biologically-relevant substrates (∼ 0.5 μM IC<sub>50</sub> on AP site-containing DNA), mitoxantrone also incised AP site-containing DNA by catalyzing β- and β/δ-elimination reactions. The efficiency of these reactions to generate the 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and 3' phosphate products was modulated by DNA structure. Although these cell-free reactions revealed that mitoxantrone can generate 3' phosphates, cells lacking polynucleotide kinase phosphatase did not show increased sensitivity to mitoxantrone treatment. Consistent with its ability to inhibit APE1 activity on DNAs containing either an AP site or a 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, combined exposures to clinically-relevant concentrations of mitoxantrone and a small molecule APE1 inhibitor revealed additive cytotoxicity. These data suggest that in a cellular context, mitoxantrone may interfere with APE1 DNA repair functions.",

It is well known that metastasis establishment, cell survival, and progression are affected by tumour-host cell interactions where changes in the host cellular compartments likely play an important role. In this context, miRNAs transferred by tumour derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have previously been shown to create a favourable tumour microenvironment. Here, we show that miR-146a-5p is highly expressed in human melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) EVs, both in MBM cell lines as well as in biopsies, thereby modulating the brain metastatic niche. Mechanistically, miR-146a-5p was transferred to astrocytes via EV delivery and inhibited NUMB in the Notch signalling pathway. This resulted in activation of tumour-promoting cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and CXCL1). Brain metastases were significantly reduced following miR-146a-5p knockdown. Corroborating these findings, miR-146a-5p inhibition led to a reduction of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and CXCL1 in astrocytes. Following molecular docking analysis, deserpidine was identified as a functional miR-146a-5p inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo.

HCAs catalyze the reversible hydration of CO₂ into HCO₃⁻, and hence maintains the fluid and pH balance. Overexpression of CA II is associated with diseases, such as glaucoma, and epilepsy. Therefore, CAs are important clinical targets and inhibition of different isoforms, especially hCA II is used in treatment of glaucoma, altitude sickness, and epilepsy. Therapeutically used CA inhibitors (CAI) are sulfonamide-based, such as acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, etc. However, they exhibit several undesirable effects such as numbness, tingling of extremities, malaise, metallic taste, fatigue, renal calculi, and metabolic acidosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify safe and effective inhibitors of the hCAs. In this study, different phenyl boronic acids 1-5 were evaluated against bovine (bCA II) and hCA II. Among all, compound 1 (4-acetylphenyl boronic acid) was found to be active against bCAII and hCA II with IC₅₀ values of 246 ± 0.48 and 281.40 ± 2.8 μM, respectively, while the remaining compounds were found in-active. Compound 1 was identified as competitive inhibitor of hCA II enzyme (Kᵢ = 283.7 ± 0.002 μM). Additionally, compound 1 was found to be non-toxic against BJ Human fibroblast cell line. The X-ray crystal structure for hCA II in-complex with compound 1 was evaluated to a resolution of 2.6 Å. In fact, this the first structural analysis of a phenyl boron-based inhibitor bound to hCA II, allowing an additional structure-activity analysis of the compounds. Compound 1 was found to be directly bound in the active site of hCA II by interacting with His94, His119, and Thr199 residues. In addition, a bond of 3.11 Å between the zinc ion and coordinated boron atom of the boronic acid moiety of compound 1 was also observed, contributing to binding affinity of compound 1 for hCA II.

To this end, the host nucleotide metabolic pathway has been subject to intense investigation in the search for host-targeting agents (HTAs) with potential BSA activity. In particular, human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH), a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, has been identified as a preferential target of new HTAs. Viral replication in fact relies on cellular pyrimidine replenishment, making hDHODH an ideal HTA target. The depletion of the host pyrimidine pool that ensues the pharmacological inhibition of hDHODH activity elicits effective BSA activity through three distinct mechanisms: it blocks viral DNA and RNA synthesis; it activates effector mechanisms of the host innate antiviral response; and it mitigates the virus-induced inflammatory response. However, despite the spectacular results obtained in vitro, the hDHODH inhibitors examined as mono-drug therapies in animal models of human viral infections and in clinical trials have produced disappointing levels of overall antiviral efficacy. To overcome this inherent limitation, pharmacological strategies based on multi-drug combination treatments should be considered to enable efficacy of hDHODH-targeted antiviral therapies. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of antiviral applications of hDHODH inhibitors, discuss the challenges that have emerged from their testing in animal models and human clinical trials and consider how they might be addressed to advance the development of hDHODH inhibitors as BSA for the treatment of viral diseases.",

The main goal of this work is to find anti-diabetic inhibitors using in-silico evaluation techniques such as molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, principal component analysis, and drug probability analysis. The DPP-IV is one of numerous molecular targets implicated in the pathogenesis of DM and Diffractaic acid (DF) was docked into the active site of this enzyme to assess the inhibitory effect of DF. In addition, MD simulation and PCA were used to assess the stability of docked complex. Furthermore, the DF was then subjected to drug probability investigations. The binding affinity of the DF was - 40.2476 kcal/mol, which was comparable to the reference compound (- 43.0908 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the compound was in a stable structure, as demonstrated by MD simulation and PCA analysis. Based on drug probability tests, DF also demonstrated druggable qualities.

The side effects of the existing medicines include vomiting, diarrhea, and serious damage to the kidneys, blood vessels, and nerves. Therefore, finding anti-diabetic medications without side effects is crucial. The main goal of this work is to find anti-diabetic inhibitors using in-silico evaluation techniques such as molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, principal component analysis, and drug probability analysis. The DPP-IV is one of numerous molecular targets implicated in the pathogenesis of DM and Diffractaic acid (DF) was docked into the active site of this enzyme to assess the inhibitory effect of DF. In addition, MD simulation and PCA were used to assess the stability of docked complex. Furthermore, the DF was then subjected to drug probability investigations. The binding affinity of the DF was - 40.2476 kcal/mol, which was comparable to the reference compound (- 43.0908 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the compound was in a stable structure, as demonstrated by MD simulation and PCA analysis. Based on drug probability tests, DF also demonstrated druggable qualities. The results of this investigation suggest that DF may function as a possible inhibitor against DM; nevertheless, more in vitro and in vivo investigations are required to validate the activity and other properties.",
