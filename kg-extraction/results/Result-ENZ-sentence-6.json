The large biodiversity of micCYPs leads to the idea that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving micCYPs are not limited to classical redox partners. This review aims to perform a systems biology analysis of the complete set of PPIs for all 33 micCYPs studied, as well as to examine the subinteractome of each micCYP. We have retrieved 287 PPIs from interactomic databases, involving 246 unique protein interactors that share a similar profile of subcellular localization with micCYPs. The number of protein interactors per micCYP unevenly varies from one to 47. Interactors of micCYPs are involved in cellular metabolism, signal transduction, cell-cell junctions, cytoskeleton organization, and intracellular or transmembrane transport. Notably, up to one-third of all interactors belong to the latter group, half of which consists of membrane transporters of compounds, metabolites, and ions (e.g., CACNA2D1, ORAI1, SCN3B, SLC7A2, SLC19A3, and SLC11A2). The CYP2C8 subinteractome is enriched with proteins involved in autophagy; CYP2S1- ERBB2 and EPH-Ephrin signaling; CYP3A4- glucuronidation. Proteins UBC, PGRMC1, and FANCG are the most frequent common interactors across various micCYPs. Nine and 12 interactors of micCYPs are involved in phosphorylation and ubiquitination, respectively; 20 interactors are 'moonlighting' proteins that are represented in the CYP3A4 subinteractome. Furthermore, micCYPs such as CYP2C9, 3A5, 2E1, 2A6, 4F2, and 4A11 may be involved in potentially binary interactions with other micCYPs. The functional implication of these CYP-CYP pairs is likely associated with modulation of their activity. Analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that some micCYP/interactor pairs exhibit tissue-, time-, and disease-specific gene expression patterns. Drugs that are metabolized by micCYPs in some cases can influence the expression of corresponding interactors at the gene or protein levels. These findings suggest that micCYPs may play roles in functions beyond their monooxygenase activity, as indicated by the spectrum of PPIs analyzed.",

The transcriptional expression of activating transcription factor 4b1 (atf4b1), activating transcription factor 4b2 (atf4b2), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta 1 (camk2d1), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta 2 (camk2d2) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 2 (camk2n2) genes in the brain of females increased significantly at all treatment groups of MT, and the mRNA expression of forkhead box L2a (foxl2) and ovarian cytochrome P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a) genes in the ovaries were down-regulated by 5 and 583 ng/L group, which would translate into inhibition of oocyte development. As compared to females, MT had relatively little effects on the reproductive system of males, and only the transcriptional alterations of synaptonemal complex protein 3 (sycp3) and 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (cyp17) genes were observed in the testes, not enough to affect testicular histology. In addition, MT at all treatments strongly increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) transcript in the brain of females, as well as deiodinase 2 (dio2) transcript in the brain of males. The paired box protein 8 (pax8) gene was significantly decreased at 51 or 583 ng/L of MT in both female and male brains. The above results suggest that MT can pose potential adverse effects on the reproductive and thyroid endocrine system of fish.",

The large biodiversity of micCYPs leads to the idea that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving micCYPs are not limited to classical redox partners. This review aims to perform a systems biology analysis of the complete set of PPIs for all 33 micCYPs studied, as well as to examine the subinteractome of each micCYP. We have retrieved 287 PPIs from interactomic databases, involving 246 unique protein interactors that share a similar profile of subcellular localization with micCYPs. The number of protein interactors per micCYP unevenly varies from one to 47. Interactors of micCYPs are involved in cellular metabolism, signal transduction, cell-cell junctions, cytoskeleton organization, and intracellular or transmembrane transport. Notably, up to one-third of all interactors belong to the latter group, half of which consists of membrane transporters of compounds, metabolites, and ions (e.g., CACNA2D1, ORAI1, SCN3B, SLC7A2, SLC19A3, and SLC11A2). The CYP2C8 subinteractome is enriched with proteins involved in autophagy; CYP2S1- ERBB2 and EPH-Ephrin signaling; CYP3A4- glucuronidation. Proteins UBC, PGRMC1, and FANCG are the most frequent common interactors across various micCYPs. Nine and 12 interactors of micCYPs are involved in phosphorylation and ubiquitination, respectively; 20 interactors are 'moonlighting' proteins that are represented in the CYP3A4 subinteractome. Furthermore, micCYPs such as CYP2C9, 3A5, 2E1, 2A6, 4F2, and 4A11 may be involved in potentially binary interactions with other micCYPs. The functional implication of these CYP-CYP pairs is likely associated with modulation of their activity. Analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that some micCYP/interactor pairs exhibit tissue-, time-, and disease-specific gene expression patterns. Drugs that are metabolized by micCYPs in some cases can influence the expression of corresponding interactors at the gene or protein levels. These findings suggest that micCYPs may play roles in functions beyond their monooxygenase activity, as indicated by the spectrum of PPIs analyzed.",

DNLA exhibits hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemia effects. However, to the best of our knowledge, the specific molecular mechanism by which DNLA can regulate lipid metabolism remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of DNLA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells and its potential mechanism. HepG2 cells were treated with LPS with or without different concentrations of DNLA (0, 0.035, 0.35 and 3.5 µg/ml) for 48 h. Cell viability was then detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanideperchlorate-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake assay was used to examine LDL uptake. In addition, possible mechanisms were explored using western blot analysis. The effect of the combination of DNLA with rosuvastatin calcium on the expression levels of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) was examined. The results indicated that LPS stimulation reduced the uptake of LDL by HepG2 cells, decreased the intracellular LDLR content, and increased the expression levels of inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL) and liver X receptor (LXR)α. DNLA intervention reversed all of the aforementioned LPS-induced effects in HepG2 cells. Additional mechanistic experiments revealed that DNLA exerted its effects mainly by regulating the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway. It was shown that DNLA also reduced the expression levels of PCSK9, sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α. In addition, DNLA decreased the expression levels of PCSK9 in rosuvastatin calcium-induced HepG2 cells. Notably, DNLA was able to decrease 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and increase cytochrome p450 7A1 expression at the protein level, which are rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. Collectively, these data suggested that DNLA could enhance LDL uptake of HepG2 cells by increasing LDLR expression through the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway to alleviate the effects induced by LPS, suggesting the potential benefit of DNLA in improving lipid metabolism disorders.",

The effect of the combination of DNLA with rosuvastatin calcium on the expression levels of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) was examined. The results indicated that LPS stimulation reduced the uptake of LDL by HepG2 cells, decreased the intracellular LDLR content, and increased the expression levels of inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL) and liver X receptor (LXR)α. DNLA intervention reversed all of the aforementioned LPS-induced effects in HepG2 cells. Additional mechanistic experiments revealed that DNLA exerted its effects mainly by regulating the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway. It was shown that DNLA also reduced the expression levels of PCSK9, sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α. In addition, DNLA decreased the expression levels of PCSK9 in rosuvastatin calcium-induced HepG2 cells. Notably, DNLA was able to decrease 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and increase cytochrome p450 7A1 expression at the protein level, which are rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. Collectively, these data suggested that DNLA could enhance LDL uptake of HepG2 cells by increasing LDLR expression through the LXRα/IDOL/LDLR pathway to alleviate the effects induced by LPS, suggesting the potential benefit of DNLA in improving lipid metabolism disorders.",

            "source": "39284705: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily represents the major drug-metabolizing enzymes responsible for metabolizing over 65% of therapeutic drugs, including those for pediatric use. CYP-ontogeny based physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling has emerged as useful approach to mechanistically extrapolate adult pharmacokinetic data to children. However, these models integrate physiological differences in the pediatric population including age-dependent differences in the abundances of CYP enzymes. Conventionally, developmental changes in CYP enzymes have been reported using protein abundance and activity data from subcellular fractions such as microsomes, which are prone to high technical variability. Similarly, the available pediatric pharmacokinetic data suffer from the lack of specific CYP substrates, especially in younger children. In the present study, we used viable hepatocytes from 50 pediatric (age, 1 day-18 years) and 8 adult human donors and carried out global proteomics-based quantification of all major hepatic CYP enzymes, including orphan enzymes that have not been studied previously. While CYPs 2B6, 3A5, 4A11, 4F3, and 4V2 did not show a significant association with age, all other quantified isoforms either increased or decreased with age. CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 2C18, and 2C19 were absent or barely detected in the neonatal group, while CYP3A7 was the highest in this group. The >1 to 2 years age group showed the highest total abundance of all CYP enzymes. The age-dependent differences in CYP enzymes reported in this study can be used to develop ontogeny-based PBPK models, which in turn can help improve pediatric dose prediction based on adult dosing, leading to safer drug pharmacology in children. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We quantified the age-dependent differences in the abundances of hepatic CYP enzymes using a large set of viable pediatric and adult hepatocytes using quantitative global proteomics. We report for the first time the ontogeny in the abundance of CYP enzymes in human hepatocytes, especially, orphan CYPs 20A1, 27A1, 51A1, 7B1, and 8B1 and CYP4 subfamily of enzymes. Our study provides important data about CYP ontogeny that can be used for the better prediction of pediatric pharmacokinetics using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.",

We have previously shown that the bone marrow tyrosine kinase BMX is critical for inflammatory angiogenesis via its direct transactivation of VEGFR2. In the present study, we show that siRNA-mediated silencing of BMX led to a significant decrease in the total levels of VEGFR2 mRNA and protein, without affecting their stability, in human endothelial cells (ECs). Interestingly, BMX was detected in the nuclei of ECs, and the SH3 domain of BMX was necessary for its nuclear localization. Luciferase assays showed a significant decrease in the Vegfr2 (kdr) gene promoter activity in ECs after BMX silencing, indicating that BMX is necessary for Vegfr2 transcription. In addition, we found that wild-type BMX, but not a catalytic inactive mutant BMX-K445R, promoted Vegfr2 promoter activity and VEGF-induced EC migration and tube sprouting. Mechanistically, we show that the enhancement of Vegfr2 promoter activity by BMX was mediated by Sp1, a transcription factor critical for the Vegfr2 promoter. Loss of BMX significantly reduced Sp1 binding to the Vegfr2 promoter as assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Wild-type BMX, but not a kinase-inactive form of BMX, associated with and potentially phosphorylated Sp1. Moreover, a nuclear-targeted BMX (NLS-BMX), but not cytoplasm-localized form (NES-BMX), bound to Sp1 and augmented VEGFR2 expression.

Receiver operating characteristic curves on the six individual protein biomarkers identified had areas-under-the-curves (AUCs) for concussion diagnosis ≥0.78; antioxidant 1 copper chaperone (ATOX1; AUC 0.81, P = 0.003), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC; AUC 0.81, P = 0.004), cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34; AUC 0.79, P = 0.006), polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1; AUC 0.78, P = 0.008), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-like 1 (IGFBPL1; AUC 0.78, P = 0.008) and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 3A (NT5C3A; AUC 0.78, P = 0.009). Combining three of the protein biomarkers (ATOX1, SPARC and NT5C3A), produced an AUC of 0.98 for concussion diagnoses (P < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). Despite a paucity of studies on these three identified proteins, the available evidence points to their roles in modulating tissue inflammation and regulating integrity of the cerebral microvasculature. Taken together, our exploratory data suggest that three or less novel proteins, which are amenable to a point-of-care immunoassay, may be future candidate biomarkers for screening adolescent sport concussion. Validation with protein assays is required in larger cohorts.",

Designated as critically endangered, the plant is used in the treatments of bacterial infections, cancer, intestinal helminthiasis, tuberculosis, and viral infections. A methanol extract of the leaves was prepared from which 16 different compounds were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. An alkylated phenol, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, was the predominant compound. Acute toxicity test indicated that the plant extract was non-toxic even at the highest dosage tested, i.e., 2000 mg/kg body weight. The plant extract caused considerable prolongation of survival in mice transplanted with Dalton's lymphoma ascites, extending life by 33 %, with median survival time of 35.5 and average survival time of 22.83 days, and with a treatment to control ratio of 131.37 %. Reduction of body mass, lipid peroxidation, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine were seen in DLA-transplanted mice after treatment with the plant extract. On the other hand, glutathione level, glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase activity increased. Alkaline comet assay showed that the plant extract effectively induced DNA damage, producing a tail length of 11.89 μm and Olive moment of 2.36 at 250 mg/kg bwt, the most effective dosage. Molecular docking revealed high ligand binding ability of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol to chemokine receptor CXCR4, DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha, DNA topoisomerase 2-beta, histone deacetylases (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3), Janus kinase 1 and programmed cell death protein 1. The safety and anticancer activity in the present study substantiate the therapeutic importance of I. khasiana as acclaimed in the Mizo traditional medicine. Additionally, the study advocates further pharmacological investigations as well as the conservation and propagation of the endangered plant for future research.",

Acute toxicity test indicated that the plant extract was non-toxic even at the highest dosage tested, i.e., 2000 mg/kg body weight.

The safety and anticancer activity in the present study substantiate the therapeutic importance of I. khasiana as acclaimed in the Mizo traditional medicine. Additionally, the study advocates further pharmacological investigations as well as the conservation and propagation of the endangered plant for future research.",

The current study addresses these challenges by exploring remote loading of doxorubicin into liposomes, at temperatures below the phase transition temperature (PTT) of the primary phospholipid (DSPC, 55 °C). Drug loading efficiencies exceeding 90% at 45 °C were achieved, while efficiencies dropped significantly (6-fold and 23-fold) at 37 °C and 25 °C, respectively. This prompted the hypothesis that efficient drug loading might be attained below the PTT, when a minimal threshold for liposomal membrane fluidity is overcome. Using design of experiments (DoE), key factors influencing fluidity were identified: temperature, cholesterol content and surface tension (dependent on the isotonic agent). A full factorial DoE confirmed that membrane fluidity increased with lower surface tension, and high cholesterol content. A predictive model was also generated establishing a correlation between drug loading efficiency, membrane fluidity, and drug partitioning coefficient (logP). This model revealed that doxorubicin (logP = 1.5) requires a fluidity threshold of 4.41 for efficient loading (≥ 90%), whereas daunorubicin (logP = 2.32) needs a lower threshold of 3.85, suggesting that drugs with higher logP values demand lower fluidity thresholds for effective loading. The model's applicability was validated across various lipid formulations, enabling effective drug loading at temperatures as low as 25 °C, potentially reducing degradation risks and energy costs. Overall, these findings highlight the relevance of liposomal membrane fluidity studies as a potential tool for enabling more effective industrial processes.",

This assay could be of interest to researchers wanting an easier way to study hypusination, and also a valuable tool for large-scale screening of chemical libraries for new hypusination inhibitors.",

Only a few molecules able to inhibit hypusination have been described, and none are used for the treatment of patients. The scarcity of new inhibitors is probably due to the challenge of measuring DHPS and DOHH activities. Here, we describe the Hyp'Assay, a convenient cell-free assay to monitor eIF5A hypusination. Hypusination is performed in 96-well plates using recombinant human eIF5A, DHPS, and DOHH and is revealed by an antibody against hypusinated eIF5A. Pharmacological values obtained with the Hyp'Assay, such as the EC50 of DHPS for spermidine or the IC50 of GC7 for DHPS, were similar to published data, supporting the reliability of the Hyp'Assay. As a proof of concept, we synthesized four new GC7 analogs and showed, using the Hyp'Assay, that these derivatives inhibit hypusination.

Overall health effects of GEN and DAI in humans exhibit a dual nature, presenting both health benefits and concerns related to their interaction with the estrogen receptor. The metabolomes of these isoflavones were determined in 28-day oral studies in male and female Wistar rats to elucidate (1) metabolites changes, (2) compare their metabolomes with other compounds and (3) identify toxicological modes of action (MoA). Dose levels for GEN were 1000 and 300 mg/kg bw by gavage and 1000 and 300 ppm (via diet). DAI gavage dose levels were 1000 and 100 mg/kg bw. Results were evaluated using the MetaMap®Tox data base. Both compounds demonstrated metabolome profiles which were associated with estrogenic profiles and compounds, predominantly in females. However, the metabolomes were compound specific with relatively few common metabolite changes. There were no relevant matches between any GEN and any DAI treatment group indicating that both compounds are substantially different from metabolome perspective. Ranking of the metabolome patters for GEN and DAI with ≥ 1000 compounds in the MetaMap®Tox database revealed correlations with estrogenic and other hormonally active compounds. GEN-treated females correlated best with Cabergoline, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, DAI females with tamoxifen and diethylstilbestrol, suggesting that even their estrogenic activity may be different. Beyond estrogenic effects, the high dose (HD) DAI metabolome indicated altered fatty acid metabolism associated with PPAR-alpha activation. For GEN, there was an indication of ethanolamine-like liver effects. Dose levels without estrogenic effects for GEN were 1000 and 100 mg/kg bw for males and females respectively, there were no estrogenic effects in the feeding studies. For DAI males, the no estrogenic effect level was 300 mg/kg bw, for females < 100 mg/kg bw, suggesting that DAI may be a more potent estrogen than GEN in rats. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39954026/",

The side effects of the existing medicines include vomiting, diarrhea, and serious damage to the kidneys, blood vessels, and nerves. Therefore, finding anti-diabetic medications without side effects is crucial. The main goal of this work is to find anti-diabetic inhibitors using in-silico evaluation techniques such as molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, principal component analysis, and drug probability analysis. The DPP-IV is one of numerous molecular targets implicated in the pathogenesis of DM and Diffractaic acid (DF) was docked into the active site of this enzyme to assess the inhibitory effect of DF. In addition, MD simulation and PCA were used to assess the stability of docked complex. Furthermore, the DF was then subjected to drug probability investigations. The binding affinity of the DF was - 40.2476 kcal/mol, which was comparable to the reference compound (- 43.0908 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the compound was in a stable structure, as demonstrated by MD simulation and PCA analysis. Based on drug probability tests, DF also demonstrated druggable qualities. The results of this investigation suggest that DF may function as a possible inhibitor against DM; nevertheless, more in vitro and in vivo investigations are required to validate the activity and other properties.",
