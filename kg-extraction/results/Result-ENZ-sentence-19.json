However, the full genotype-phenotype spectrum and progression of the disease remain to be defined. Notably, a multicenter phase 2/3 study to test the efficacy of govorestat (NCT05397665), a new aldose reductase inhibitor, is currently ongoing. Diagnosing CMT-SORD will become imperative when disease-modifying therapies become available. In this cross-sectional multicentre study, we identified 144 patients from 126 families, including 99 males (69%) and 45 females (31%). Patients represented multiple ancestries, including European, Hispanic, Chinese, Near Eastern, and Northern African. We confirmed c.757delG (p.Ala253GlnfsTer27) as the most common pathogenic allele, followed by c.458C>A (p.Ala153Asp), while other variants were identified mostly in single cases. The average sorbitol level in CMT-SORD patients was significantly higher compared to controls and heterozygous carriers, independently from serum storage duration, sex, or variant type. Two-thirds of cases were diagnosed with CMT2 while one-third had distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). Disease onset was usually in the second decade of life. Although foot dorsiflexion was the most affected muscle group, dorsal and plantar flexion had a similar degree of weakness in most cases (difference of Medical Research Council score ≤ 1). One fourth of patients used ankle foot orthoses, usually in their 30s, but most patients maintained independent ambulation later in life. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were suggestive of a motor predominant axonal neuropathy, with reduced conduction velocities in the intermediate range in one fourth of the cases. Sensory conductions in the upper limbs appeared more frequently affected than in the lower limbs. Foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion decreased significantly with age. Male sex was significantly associated with the severity of distal lower limb weakness (plantar flexion) and a larger change over time (dorsiflexion). In conclusion, CMT-SORD is a frequent recessive form of axonal, motor predominant CMT, with prominent foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion involvement. Fasting serum sorbitol is a reliable biomarker of the condition that can be utilized for pathogenicity assessment of identified rare SORD variants. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39938083/",

Sensory conductions in the upper limbs appeared more frequently affected than in the lower limbs. Foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion decreased significantly with age. Male sex was significantly associated with the severity of distal lower limb weakness (plantar flexion) and a larger change over time (dorsiflexion). In conclusion, CMT-SORD is a frequent recessive form of axonal, motor predominant CMT, with prominent foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion involvement. Fasting serum sorbitol is a reliable biomarker of the condition that can be utilized for pathogenicity assessment of identified rare SORD variants. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39938083/",

In this cross-sectional multicentre study, we identified 144 patients from 126 families, including 99 males (69%) and 45 females (31%). Patients represented multiple ancestries, including European, Hispanic, Chinese, Near Eastern, and Northern African.

These lipids regulate membrane fluidity and protein-lipid interactions, directly influencing ion channel activity, trafficking, and signaling pathways essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Despite their fundamental role, the impact of sphingolipids on ion channel functionality, particularly within the nervous system, remains insufficiently understood. This study addresses this gap by examining the influence of sphingolipids on transient receptor potential canonical 5 (TRPC5), a key brain ion channel involved in sensory transduction and linked to conditions such as obesity, anxiety, and postpartum depression when disrupted. In this study, we demonstrate that TRPC5 is localized within lipid rafts. Inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis through myrioncin (Myr), the sphingomyelin synthase 2 inhibitor Ly93, or D,L-erythro-PDMP hydrochloride (PMDP) significantly disrupts TRPC5 localization at the plasma membrane. Treatment with lipid raft disruptors methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) or sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), in conjunction with sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors, led to decreased TRPC5-mediated calcium flux and currents. This highlights the critical importance of TRPC5 localization in lipid rafts for its functionality. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS-based sphingolipidomics has shown that a balanced sphingolipid profile is crucial for channel function. Alterations in sphingolipid metabolism, especially the deficiency of sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids, may primarily disrupt lipid raft structure. Interactions between amino acid residues with phenyl ring side chains and lipids at the inner and outer plasma membrane edges serve as 'fixators', anchoring TRPC5 channels within lipid rafts. Given the structural similarities among TRP channels, we propose that sphingolipid metabolic homeostasis may universally influence TRP channel activity, potentially explaining diverse neurological disorder phenotypes associated with sphingolipid metabolism disruptions.",

Among the newly synthesised inhibitors, compound 11 showed the highest potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4 nM) and the related compound 14 presented a template for further development. A combined docking and molecular dynamics approach was used to identify the possible target binding modes of the compounds.",

Chronic diarrhea from infancy and/or neonatal cholestasis may be the earliest clinical manifestation. In approximately 75% of affected individuals, cataracts are the first finding, often appearing in the first decade of life. Xanthomas appear in the second or third decade; they occur on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand, the patellar tendon, and the neck tendons. Xanthomas have been reported in the lung, bones, and central nervous system. Some individuals show cognitive impairment from early infancy, whereas the majority have normal or only slightly impaired intellectual function until puberty; dementia with slow deterioration in intellectual abilities occurs in the third decade in more than 50% of individuals. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as behavioral changes, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, depression, and suicide attempts may be prominent. Pyramidal signs (i.e., spasticity) and/or cerebellar signs almost invariably become evident between ages 20 and 30 years. The biochemical abnormalities that distinguish CTX from other conditions with xanthomas include high plasma and tissue cholestanol concentration, normal-to-low plasma cholesterol concentration, decreased chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), increased concentration of bile alcohols and their glyconjugates, and increased concentrations of cholestanol and apolipoprotein B in cerebrospinal fluid.",

Recent cryo-EM data suggested that Y361, E386, and R439, referred to as the YER motif, could be important for transport. Building on this, we used extensive functional analyses to investigate the general function, and the substrate-specific effects of the YER motif. We determined the activity of the Y361A, E386A, and R439A mutants for fifteen OCT1 substrates. Extended mutagenesis revealed the negative charge of E386 and the positive charge of R439 as essential for the transport of all substrates tested. Charge reversal mutants, E386R-R439E, did not restore transport activity, suggesting that at least one of the two amino acids is involved in additional interactions essential for transport. Y361 exhibited substrate-specific effects. The Y361A mutant transported fenoterol, but not pirbuterol or other beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic drugs with only one aromatic ring. MD simulations suggested that substrates with aromatic or lipophilic characteristics may compensate for the missing aromatic ring at position 361. Only tryptophan at codon 361 efficiently rescued the transport of the Y361A mutant supporting hydrogen bound interaction with E386 and R439. Our study confirms that the YER motif is essential for OCT1 transport and points to Y361 as a lever that interacts with E386 and R439 to trigger the closing of the binding pocket of human OCT1.",

The immune system recognizes the changes caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation; it produces antibodies and causes inflammation of the skin in the exposed areas (2). Common photoallergic drugs and ingredients are included in some sunscreens, aftershave lotions, antimicrobials (especially sulfonamides), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diuretics, anticonvulsants, chemotherapy drugs, fragrances, and other hygiene products (1,3,4). A 64-year-old female patient was admitted to the Department of Dermatology and Venereology with erythema and underlining edema on her left foot (Figure 1). A few weeks earlier, the patient had had a fracture of the metatarsal bones and since then she had been taking NSAIDs systemically every day to suppress pain. Five days before being admitted to our Department, the patient started applying 2.5% ketoprofen gel to her left foot twice daily and was frequently exposed to the sun. For the last twenty years, the patient had been struggling with chronic back pain and was frequently taking different NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc.). The patient also suffered from essential hypertension and was regularly taking ramipril. She was advised to discontinue ketoprofen application, avoid sunlight, and apply betamethasone cream twice daily for 7 days, which lead to complete resolution of the skin lesions in a few weeks. Two months later, we performed patch and photopatch tests to baseline series and topical ketoprofen. Only the irradiated side of the body where ketoprofen-containing gel was applied showed positive reaction to ketoprofen. Photoallergic reactions manifest as eczematous, pruritic lesions, which may spread to involve other areas of the skin that were not previously exposed to the sun (4). Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug composed of a benzoylphenyl propionic acid that is commonly used both topically and systemically for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases because of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects and low toxicity, but it is one of the most frequent photoallergens (1,5,6). Ketoprofen-induced photosensitivity reactions usually present as photoallergic dermatitis characterized as acute dermatitis with edema, erythema, papulovesicles, blisters, or erythema exsudativum multiforme-like lesions at the application site 1 week to 1 month after the initiation of use (7). Depending on the frequency and intensity of sun exposure, ketoprofen photodermatitis may continue or reoccur up to 1 to 14 years after discontinuing the medication (6,8). Moreover, ketoprofen contaminates clothing, shoes, and bandages, and some cases of photoallergy relapses have been reported that were induced by ketoprofen-contaminated objects after they were used again in the presence of UV radiation (5,6). Due to their similar biochemical structure, patients with ketoprofen photoallergy should avoid using some drugs such as some NSAIDs (suprofen, tiaprofenic acid), antilipidemic agent (fenofibrate) and sunscreens based on benzophenones (6,9). Physicians and pharmacists should advise patients of the potential risks when topical NSAIDs are applied on the photoexposed skin. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36812283/",

The current treatment of CRPS is challenging. However, recent advances in diagnostic and treatment methods show promise for improving patient outcomes. This review aims to place the question of CRPS in a broader context and highlight the objectives of the research for future directions in the management of CRPS. Methods: This study involved a comprehensive literature review. Results: Research has identified three primary pathophysiological pathways that may explain the clinical variability observed in CRPS: inflammatory mechanisms, vasomotor dysfunction, and maladaptive neuroplasticity. Investigations into these pathways have spurred the development of novel diagnostic and treatment strategies focused on N-Methyl-D-aspartate Receptor Antagonists (NMDA), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), α1 and α2 adrenoreceptors, as well as the identification of microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers. Treatment methods being explored include immune and glial-modulating agents, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, plasma exchange therapy, and neuromodulation techniques. Additionally, there is ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of other treatments, such as free radical scavengers, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), dimethyl fumarate (DMF), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators such as metformin, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as tadalafil. Conclusions: The controversies surrounding the mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of CRPS have prompted researchers to investigate new approaches aimed at enhancing understanding and management of the condition, with the goal of alleviating symptoms and reducing associated disabilities.",

Results: Research has identified three primary pathophysiological pathways that may explain the clinical variability observed in CRPS: inflammatory mechanisms, vasomotor dysfunction, and maladaptive neuroplasticity. Investigations into these pathways have spurred the development of novel diagnostic and treatment strategies focused on N-Methyl-D-aspartate Receptor Antagonists (NMDA), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), α1 and α2 adrenoreceptors, as well as the identification of microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers. Treatment methods being explored include immune and glial-modulating agents, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, plasma exchange therapy, and neuromodulation techniques. Additionally, there is ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of other treatments, such as free radical scavengers, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), dimethyl fumarate (DMF), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators such as metformin, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as tadalafil. Conclusions: The controversies surrounding the mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of CRPS have prompted researchers to investigate new approaches aimed at enhancing understanding and management of the condition, with the goal of alleviating symptoms and reducing associated disabilities.",

Here, we characterize a variable number tandem repeat within TERT intron 6, VNTR6-1 (38-bp repeat unit), and detect a strong link between VNTR6-1 alleles (Short: 24-27 repeats, Long: 40.5-66.5 repeats) and GWAS signals rs2242652 and rs10069690 within TERT intron 4. Bioinformatics analyses reveal that rs10069690-T allele increases intron 4 retention while VNTR6-1-Long allele expands a polymorphic G-quadruplex (G4, 35-113 copies) within intron 6, with both variants contributing to variable TERT expression through alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. In two cell lines, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of VNTR6-1 increases the ratio of TERT-full-length (FL) to the alternative TERT-β isoform, promoting apoptosis and reducing cell proliferation. In contrast, treatment with G4-stabilizing ligands shifts splicing from TERT-FL to TERT-β isoform, implicating VNTR6-1 as a splicing switch. We associate the functional variants VNTR6-1, rs10069690, and their haplotypes with multi-cancer risk and age-related telomere shortening. By regulating TERT splicing, these variants may contribute to fine-tuning cellular longevity and replicative potential in the context of stress due to tissue-specific endogenous and exogenous exposures, thereby influencing the cancer risk conferred by this locus.",

Bioinformatics analyses reveal that rs10069690-T allele increases intron 4 retention while VNTR6-1-Long allele expands a polymorphic G-quadruplex (G4, 35-113 copies) within intron 6, with both variants contributing to variable TERT expression through alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay. In two cell lines, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of VNTR6-1 increases the ratio of TERT-full-length (FL) to the alternative TERT-β isoform, promoting apoptosis and reducing cell proliferation. In contrast, treatment with G4-stabilizing ligands shifts splicing from TERT-FL to TERT-β isoform, implicating VNTR6-1 as a splicing switch.

In the present study, male Wister albino rats were intoxicated with a total cumulative dose of DOX (18 mg/kg) via intra-peritoneal injection and served as positive control group. The other two groups administered either TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX or lactoferrin-DOX. Furthermore, biochemical and molecular analyses were then performed. DOX intoxication induced testicular toxicity, revealing mineral imbalance as indicated by an increase in both calcium and magnesium concentrations. Administration of either TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX or lactoferrin-DOX resulted in a significant modulation of disrupted mineral concentrations, with TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX showing superiority in modulating both magnesium and calcium concentrations. Acid Phosphatase level significantly increased upon DOX-induced testicular damage. Molecular analysis of EGFR and K-RAS gene expression showed significant overexpression, while p53 and JAK-2 gene expression was significantly reduced post-DOX intoxication. Protein expression of both AKT and PI3K significantly increased upon DOX administration. Results showed a remarkable modulation of all disrupted gene and protein expressions upon treatment with TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX or Lactoferrin-DOX with the superiority of TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX in modulating these parameters. In conclusion, TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX could be a promising drug delivery system to improve bioavailability and drug release, as well as reducing DOX's adverse effects particularly on testicular function.",

However, its therapeutic application is highly limited due to acute and chronic renal, hematological and testicular toxicity. Oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis in germ cells as well as low sperm count, motility and disturbing steroidogenesis are the principal machineries of DOX-induced testicular toxicity. Nevertheless, the comprehensive molecular pathways responsible for DOX-induced testicular damage are not yet fully understood. The current study aims to clarify the role of autophagy and apoptotic signaling pathways in testicular toxicity induced by DOX in the rat model. The study also investigates the potential role of both titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub>NP) loaded with DOX and Lactoferrin in combination with DOX in mitigating testicular toxicity induced by DOX the standard antitumor drug. In the present study, male Wister albino rats were intoxicated with a total cumulative dose of DOX (18 mg/kg) via intra-peritoneal injection and served as positive control group. The other two groups administered either TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX or lactoferrin-DOX. Furthermore, biochemical and molecular analyses were then performed. DOX intoxication induced testicular toxicity, revealing mineral imbalance as indicated by an increase in both calcium and magnesium concentrations. Administration of either TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX or lactoferrin-DOX resulted in a significant modulation of disrupted mineral concentrations, with TiO<sub>2</sub>NP-DOX showing superiority in modulating both magnesium and calcium concentrations. Acid Phosphatase level significantly increased upon DOX-induced testicular damage. Molecular analysis of EGFR and K-RAS gene expression showed significant overexpression, while p53 and JAK-2 gene expression was significantly reduced post-DOX intoxication.

In this work, a novel enzymatic cascade system was constructed for synthesis of testolactone by specific C17 lactonization/Δ1-dehydrogenation from inexpensive androstenedione using an engineered polycyclic ketone monooxygenase (PockeMO) and an appropriate 3-ketosteroid-Δ1-dehydrogenase (ReKstD). The focused saturation mutagenesis in the substrate binding pocket was implemented for evolution of PockeMO to eliminate the bottleneck effect. A best mutant MU3 (I225L/L226V/L532Y) was obtained with 20-fold higher specific activity compared to PockeMO. The catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/Km) of MU3 was 171-fold higher and the substrate scope shifted to polycyclic ketones. Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that the activity was improved by stabilization of the pre-lactonization state and generation of productive orientation of 4-AD mediated by distal L532Y mutation. Based on that, the three genes, MU3, ReKstD and a ketoreductase for NADPH regeneration, were rationally integrated in one cell via expression fine-tuning to form the efficient single cell catalyst E. coli S9. The single whole-cell biocatalytic process was scaled up and could generate 9.0 g/L testolactone with the high space time yield of 1 g/L/h without steroidal by-product, indicating the potential for site-specific and one-pot synthesis of steroid.",

            "source": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia among elderly people worldwide. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the optimal fluid source for AD biomarkers, while serum biomarkers are much more achievable. To search for novel diagnostic AD biomarkers, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of CSF and serum samples from AD and normal cognitive controls (NC). CSF and serum proteomes were analyzed via data-independent acquisition quantitative mass spectrometry. Our bioinformatic analysis was based on Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment. In comparison to the controls, 8 proteins were more abundant in AD CSF, and 60 were less abundant in AD CSF, whereas 55 proteins were more and 10 were less abundant in the serum samples. ATPase-associated activity for CSF and mitochondrial functions for CSF and serum were the most enriched GO terms of the DEPs. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the most significant pathways for the differentially expressed proteins were the N-glycan biosynthesis pathways. The area under the curve (AUC) values for CSF sodium-/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 (AT1B1), serglycin (SRGN), and thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, mitochondrial (PRDX3) were 0.867 (p = 0.004), 0.833 (p = 0.008), and 0.783 (p = 0.025), respectively. A panel of the above three CSF proteins accurately differentiated AD (AUC = 0.933, p = 0.001) from NC. The AUC values for serum probable phospholipid-transporting ATPase IM (AT8B4) and SRGN were moderate. The AUC of the CSF SRGN + serum SRGN was 0.842 (p = 0.007). These novel AD biomarker candidates are mainly associated with inflammation, ATPase activity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which these potential biomarkers are involved in AD.",

            "source": "RESULTS: In our study, firstly, we identify 21 major bioactive components from Huachansu. CCK-8 assay results showed that Huachansu and its bioactive bufadienolides (Bufalin, Bufotalin, Cinobufotalin, Desacetylcinobufagin, Arenobufagin, Telocinobufagin, and Resibufogenin) significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and SK-HEP-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further molecular mechanistic investigation demonstrates that Huachansu significantly suppresses thymidylate synthase (TYMS), the enzyme which provides the sole de novo source of thymidylate for DNA synthesis. The inhibition of TYMS could lead to cell-cycle block and DNA damage of HCC cells. Furthermore, we identified that Huachansu markedly increased γ-H2AX expression, which indicated the presence of DNA damage. Moreover, we confirmed that transfection of cells with small interfering RNA specific to TYMS could increase the suppressive effects of Huachansu on the HCC cells proliferation.

Furthermore, we identified that Huachansu markedly increased γ-H2AX expression, which indicated the presence of DNA damage. Moreover, we confirmed that transfection of cells with small interfering RNA specific to TYMS could increase the suppressive effects of Huachansu on the HCC cells proliferation. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that Huachansu treatment had no effect on the transcription level of TYMS. Furthermore, proteasomal inhibitor MG132 could block TYMS inhibition induced by Huachansu, and concomitant administration of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) with Huachansu could further suppress the protein level of TYMS, indicating that Huachansu promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of TYMS in liver cancer cells. More importantly, the bioactive bufadienolides of Huachansu such as Bufalin, Bufotalin, Cinobufotalin, Desacetylcinobufagin, Arenobufagin, Telocinobufagin, and Resibufogenin could also significantly restrain the protein level of TYMS, revealing the material basis of inhibition of TYMS exposed to Huachansu. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a TYMS inhibitor, we also evaluate the effects of the combined treatment of Huachansu with 5-FU, the results show that interactions between Huachansu and 5-FU are synergistic or antagonistic. Thus, in clinical, attention should be paid to the dosage of Huachansu in combination with 5-FU.",

Microtubule destabilizing agents (MDAs) targeting the colchicine site were found to have the advantage of being able to overcome drug resistance. In our previous studies, we identified a novel MDA from the compound database based on virtual screening methods. Its chemical formula is C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>19</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S, abbreviated as C10. In this study, molecular docking methods confirmed that the binding pattern of C10 to tubulin is similar to that of colchicine. Immunofluorescence staining and tubulin polymerization experiments showed that C10 disrupts the microtubule network and reduces the polymerization efficiency of tubulin. Cell proliferation and toxicity assay showed that C10 could effectively inhibit the growth of tumour cells. After 72 h treatment, the semi-inhibitory concentrations of A549, MCF-7 and HepG2 were 18.83 μM, 16.32 μM and 16.92 μM. Colony formation assay and EdU staining also showed that C10 significantly inhibited the proliferative capacity of tumour cells. Meanwhile, it was found by wound healing and transwell assay that the migration and invasive ability of tumour cells were relatively weakened after treatment with C10. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis and western blot revealed that C10 reduced the expression of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and upregulated the level of the Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), which in turn activated caspase-3 to promote apoptosis. Finally, the vivo studies in animal showed that C10 significantly inhibited the growth of tumour in nude mice without significant drug toxicity. Thus, C10 may be a colchicine binding site inhibitor with anticancer potential.",

However, analysis of tastants' intake and preference revealed no significant effects of tPA overexpression, indicating that it does not influence hedonic responses under stress conditions. Molecularly, tPA overexpression preserved hippocampal tPA mRNA expression and maintained levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus despite chronic stress exposure. These findings highlight the potential neuroprotective effects of tPA in maintaining hippocampal plasticity and mitigating stress-induced dysregulation of critical neurotrophic pathways.

In stage 2 (phase 2a dose-expansion stage), participants were randomly assigned (3:3:3:2) to receive one of three doses of oral BTZ-043 (decided after stage 1) or standard of care (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) using sealed opaque envelopes. The BTZ-043 groups also received oral dolutegravir (a third of participants) or a probe drug cocktail (caffeine [probe for CYP1A2], tolbutamide [CYP2C9], dextromethorphan [CYP2D6], midazolam [CYP3A4], and digoxin [P-glycoprotein]; two-thirds of participants). Study staff and participants were not masked, but laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was to assess the safety and tolerability of BTZ-43 over 14 days of dosing by evaluation of adverse events in the safety analysis population. Secondary outcomes were bactericidal activity, measured by time to positivity (TTP) and colony-forming unit (CFU) count; pharmacokinetics (stage 2; including the food effect on BTZ-043); and drug-drug interactions with CYP450 enzymes, P-glycoprotein, and dolutegravir. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04044001 (completed). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39793592/",

The most frequently observed adverse events were nausea (12 [8%] of 154), headache (11 [7%]), dizziness (11 [7%]), and vomiting (eight [5%]). Most participants had adverse events of mild (46 [60%] of 77 participants) or moderate (22 [29%]) severity. Transient increases in alanine aminotransferase were observed in both stages, which declined again despite continued dosing and were classified as signs of adaptation of hepatic metabolism rather than hepatotoxicity.

The polyol pathway aka aldose reductase (AR) pathway has gained significant association with diabetic retinopathy with regard to chronically enhanced glucose metabolism. Considerable research has been put forth to develop more effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the overwhelming challenges of vascular complications associated with diabetes. In this regard, constituents of Cichorium intybus can offer strong AR inhibitory potential because of their strong antidiabetic properties. Therefore, aim of this study was to investigate the AR inhibitory as well as antiglycation potential of C. intybus extract/compounds. The preliminary in vitro results showed that methanolic extract of C. intybus could significantly inhibit AR enzyme and advanced glycation end product formation. Eventually, based on previous studies and reviews, we selected one hundred fifteen C. intybus root constituents and screened them through Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET analysis. Later, after molecular docking analysis of eight compounds, five best were selected for molecular dynamics simulation to deduce their binding affinity with the AR enzyme. Finally, three out of five compounds were further tested in vitro for their AR inhibitory potential and antiglycation properties. Enzyme assay and kinetic studies showed that all the three tested compounds were having potent AR inhibitory properties, although to a lesser extent than ellagic acid and tolrestat. Similarly, kaempferol showed strong antiglycation property equivalent to ellagic acid, but greater than aminoguanidine. Intriguingly, significant reduction in sorbitol accumulation in RBCs by the tested compounds substantiated strong AR inhibition by these compounds. Moreover, decrease in sorbitol accumulation under high glucose environment also signifies the potential application of these compounds in diabetic retinopathy and other vascular complications. Thus, in sum, the in silico and in vitro studies combinedly showed that C. intybus root is a treasure for therapeutic compounds and can be explored further for drug development against diabetic retinopathy.",

Thus, in sum, the in silico and in vitro studies combinedly showed that C. intybus root is a treasure for therapeutic compounds and can be explored further for drug development against diabetic retinopathy.",

            "source": "39002911: Diabetic vascular complication including diabetic retinopathy is a major morbidity in Saudia Arabia. The polyol pathway aka aldose reductase (AR) pathway has gained significant association with diabetic retinopathy with regard to chronically enhanced glucose metabolism. Considerable research has been put forth to develop more effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the overwhelming challenges of vascular complications associated with diabetes. In this regard, constituents of Cichorium intybus can offer strong AR inhibitory potential because of their strong antidiabetic properties. Therefore, aim of this study was to investigate the AR inhibitory as well as antiglycation potential of C. intybus extract/compounds. The preliminary in vitro results showed that methanolic extract of C. intybus could significantly inhibit AR enzyme and advanced glycation end product formation. Eventually, based on previous studies and reviews, we selected one hundred fifteen C. intybus root constituents and screened them through Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET analysis. Later, after molecular docking analysis of eight compounds, five best were selected for molecular dynamics simulation to deduce their binding affinity with the AR enzyme. Finally, three out of five compounds were further tested in vitro for their AR inhibitory potential and antiglycation properties. Enzyme assay and kinetic studies showed that all the three tested compounds were having potent AR inhibitory properties, although to a lesser extent than ellagic acid and tolrestat. Similarly, kaempferol showed strong antiglycation property equivalent to ellagic acid, but greater than aminoguanidine.
