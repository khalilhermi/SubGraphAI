We used sensitive sequence similarity searches to expand this large CPBP (CAAX proteases and bacteriocin-processing enzymes) family to include more than 5800 members and infer its homologous relationships to several other protein families, including the PrsW proteases, the DUF2324 (DUF, domain of unknown function) family and the γ-secretase subunit APH-1 proteins. They share four predicted core transmembrane segments and possess similar yet distinct sets of sequence motifs. Remote similarity between APH-1 and membrane proteases sheds light on APH-1's evolutionary origin and raises the possibility that APH-1 may possess proteolytic activity in the current or ancestral form of γ-secretase.",

It has negative impact on patient's quality of life. Multiple treatments are introduced to treat onychomycosis but they are limited by high cost, side effects, drug interaction, and reduced transungual delivery. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of calcipotriol 0.005% cream versus terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream in treatment of onychomycosis. Twenty adult patients with bilateral onychomycosis were randomized. Twenty adult patients with bilateral onychomycosis were randomized in this study. The patients received calcipotriol 0.005% cream on one side and terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream on the other side twice/day for 3 months. Outcome was evaluated after treatment by onychomycosis severity index (OSI), mycological evaluation, investigator's assessment and patient's satisfaction. Side effects were also evaluated.

Calcipotriol 0.005% cream had significant higher degree of improvement after 3-month treatment of onychomycosis compared to terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream (p value = 0.02), while calcipotriol had significantly higher side effects in terms of tolerable irritation compared to terbenafine (p value < 0.05). Insignificant differences between both sides were found regarding post treatment OSI, investigator's assessment and patient's satisfaction (p value = 0.12, 0.73, 0.22 respectively). This pilot study provided preliminary data for significant superiority of calcipotriol 0.005% cream in treatment of onychomycosis regarding degree of improvement after 3-month treatment compared to terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream. Irritation induced by calcipotriol 0.005% cream was tolerable by the patients. Further studies are still needed. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39951153/",

It has negative impact on patient's quality of life. Multiple treatments are introduced to treat onychomycosis but they are limited by high cost, side effects, drug interaction, and reduced transungual delivery. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of calcipotriol 0.005% cream versus terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream in treatment of onychomycosis. Twenty adult patients with bilateral onychomycosis were randomized. Twenty adult patients with bilateral onychomycosis were randomized in this study. The patients received calcipotriol 0.005% cream on one side and terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream on the other side twice/day for 3 months.

Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ARX788 (1.5 mg/kg, IV, Q3W) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (LC: lapatinib 1250 mg QD; capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID, days 1-14, Q3W) and stratified by prior chemotherapy lines (0-1 versus >1) and visceral metastasis (yes versus no). The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). A total of 441 patients were randomly assigned to receive either ARX788 (n = 221) or LC (n = 220). The median PFS was 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.8) months with ARX788 compared with 8.2 (95% CI, 6.9-8.7) months with LC, as per BICR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, p = 0.0006). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were 98.6% and 99.1% for ARX788 and LC, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 41.4% and 40.0%, respectively, the most common adverse events were blurred vision (12.3%), dry eye (9.1%), keratopathy (5.9%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD, 5.9%) with ARX788; hand-foot syndrome (18.1%) and hypokalemia (5.1%) with LC; all the hematological and gastrointestinal events of grade ≥3 with ARX788 were less than 3%. Six treatment-related deaths occurred, with three cases possibly related to ILD. ARX788 significantly improved PFS compared with LC in patients with HER2-positive ABC with a distinct toxicity profile, supporting it as a potential treatment option.",

Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ARX788 (1.5 mg/kg, IV, Q3W) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (LC: lapatinib 1250 mg QD; capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID, days 1-14, Q3W) and stratified by prior chemotherapy lines (0-1 versus >1) and visceral metastasis (yes versus no). The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). A total of 441 patients were randomly assigned to receive either ARX788 (n = 221) or LC (n = 220). The median PFS was 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.8) months with ARX788 compared with 8.2 (95% CI, 6.9-8.7) months with LC, as per BICR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, p = 0.0006). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were 98.6% and 99.1% for ARX788 and LC, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 41.4% and 40.0%, respectively, the most common adverse events were blurred vision (12.3%), dry eye (9.1%), keratopathy (5.9%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD, 5.9%) with ARX788; hand-foot syndrome (18.1%) and hypokalemia (5.1%) with LC; all the hematological and gastrointestinal events of grade ≥3 with ARX788 were less than 3%. Six treatment-related deaths occurred, with three cases possibly related to ILD.

This study aims to explore the link between the ABCB1 c.3435C > T genetic variation and Carbamazepine resistance and toxicity in Algerian patients with epilepsy, with a focus on the impact of genetic variations on Carbamazepine plasma concentrations and treatment outcomes. Ninety-eight Algerian patients with epilepsy were recruited and categorized as either drug-responsive or drug-resistant based on their clinical response to CBZ treatment. Genotyping of the ABCB1 c.3435 C > T polymorphism was performed using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method, and CBZ plasma levels were measured to assess its effect on metabolism. Clinical data, including drug response, therapy type, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), were collected and analyzed. For the statistical analysis we used chi-squared tests and Exact Fisher's for corrections. Our findings show no significant association between the ABCB1 c.3435C > T genotypes with carbamazepine resistance (p = 0,1) nor incidence of adverse reactions.

However, CA activity was thought to be a side effect or even a contamination of other CAs because of the relatively low rates of CA reactions in PSII measured previously. Here, by using 8-hydroxy-pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (pyranine), a fluorescent dye, as a pH indicator, we show that PSII preparations (∗∗BBYs) from Pisum sativum have a high CA activity (as measured by HCO3 dehydration), which is close to that of highly active CAs. This fluorescence method is new for BBYs giving at least ten times higher activity than the other methods used earlier, as well as being highly sensitive and, thus, more convenient to use for BBYs than any other approach. We show here that the pH range of 5.0-7.5 is optimum for the pyranine measuring system, in general, and this pH range is suitable not only for the CA in BBYs but also for other CAs. Further, the CA activity of BBYs has the following unique properties: (1) low sensitivity to some known, and otherwise, effective CA inhibitors; (2) an opposite pH profile of HCO3 dehydration than observed in other known CAs. These findings indicate that the high CA activity, we have observed, belongs to BBYs, i.e., free of other CAs. At pH 6.5, CA activity of BBYs is shown to be directly correlated with that of photosynthetic O2 evolution. We propose that the CA activity may accelerate the removal of H+s during water oxidation.",

We show here that the pH range of 5.0-7.5 is optimum for the pyranine measuring system, in general, and this pH range is suitable not only for the CA in BBYs but also for other CAs. Further, the CA activity of BBYs has the following unique properties: (1) low sensitivity to some known, and otherwise, effective CA inhibitors; (2) an opposite pH profile of HCO3 dehydration than observed in other known CAs. These findings indicate that the high CA activity, we have observed, belongs to BBYs, i.e., free of other CAs. At pH 6.5, CA activity of BBYs is shown to be directly correlated with that of photosynthetic O2 evolution. We propose that the CA activity may accelerate the removal of H+s during water oxidation.",

Immunostaining for CAIV was performed on female reproductive organs (ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, vagina) of non-pregnant mice and on implantation sites of early pregnancy between 4.5 and 9.5 days post coitum (dpc). Sex typing of embryos was performed by PCR using three separated gene combinations for X- and Y-chromosomes, respectively. Additionally, reproductive outcome of CAIV-deficient mice was determined. CAIV is largely absent in the female reproductive organs of non-pregnant mice. Immunostaining for CAIV was present in the blastocyst and in consecutive stages of the developing embryo. In the endometrial epithelium distant from the implantation chamber, CAIV is induced from 8.5 dpc onwards. Moreover, the yolk sac epithelium, the trophoblast giant cells and the labyrinthine compartment of the developing hemochorial placenta shows a strong immunostaining for CAIV. In heterozygous mating, the number of CAIV knockout pups is significantly reduced than was to be expected according to the mendelian rules, while homozygous mating of CAIV knockout mice results in a significant reduction of litter size which is mainly due to a reduced number of female mice born. Since at 9.5 dpc the number of female embryos is rather higher than that of males, the observed reduction of female offspring appears to be due to a defect in placentation after 9.5 dpc. Thus, CAIV seems to be involved in the signaling network of embryo development, implantation, and placentation.",

The molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our study reveals that thiazides attenuate insulin secretion through inhibition of the mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase isoform 5b (CA5b) in pancreatic β cells. We furthermore discovered that pancreatic β cells express only one functional carbonic anhydrase isoform, CA5b, which is critical in replenishing oxaloacetate in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). These findings explain the mechanism for thiazide-induced glucose intolerance and reveal a fundamental role of CA5b in TCA cycle anaplerosis and insulin secretion in β cells.",

The molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our study reveals that thiazides attenuate insulin secretion through inhibition of the mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase isoform 5b (CA5b) in pancreatic β cells. We furthermore discovered that pancreatic β cells express only one functional carbonic anhydrase isoform, CA5b, which is critical in replenishing oxaloacetate in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). These findings explain the mechanism for thiazide-induced glucose intolerance and reveal a fundamental role of CA5b in TCA cycle anaplerosis and insulin secretion in β cells.",

Here, by using 8-hydroxy-pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (pyranine), a fluorescent dye, as a pH indicator, we show that PSII preparations (∗∗BBYs) from Pisum sativum have a high CA activity (as measured by HCO3- dehydration), which is close to that of highly active CAs. This fluorescence method is new for BBYs giving at least ten times higher activity than the other methods used earlier, as well as being highly sensitive and, thus, more convenient to use for BBYs than any other approach. We show here that the pH range of 5.0-7.5 is optimum for the pyranine measuring system, in general, and this pH range is suitable not only for the CA in BBYs but also for other CAs. Further, the CA activity of BBYs has the following unique properties: (1) low sensitivity to some known, and otherwise, effective CA inhibitors; (2) an opposite pH profile of HCO3- dehydration than observed in other known CAs. These findings indicate that the high CA activity, we have observed, belongs to BBYs, i.e., free of other CAs. At pH 6.5, CA activity of BBYs is shown to be directly correlated with that of photosynthetic O2 evolution.

Among potential targets for molecular imaging reporters, Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) stands out for its overexpression in tumors characterized by large hypoxic areas and aggressive phenotypes. CAIX, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in pH regulation, displays a unique proteoglycan-like (PG) domain, not present in other isoforms, that could represent a specific target for imaging and therapy. While high sensitivity imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and optical imaging have been applied for CAIX targeting, no in vivo study utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to target CAIX has yet been reported. Herein, we address this gap by applying CAIX PG-targeting functionalized liposomes in the first in vivo MRI study on a murine model of breast cancer. TS/A cells were subcutaneously injected to generate primary tumors in mice, and targeted liposomes were delivered intravenously after 15 days. Internalization of the targeted liposomes by receptor-mediated endocytosis led to an enhanced MRI signal in the tumor region. Cytoplasmic and endosomal distribution of the liposomes' payload was observed. Conversely, non-functionalized liposomes and liposomes bearing a scrambled peptide, while entering tumor cells in smaller amounts, localized only to endosomes as expected. The findings reported herein suggest that CAIX PG domain-targeting liposomal formulations exploiting receptor-mediated endocytosis can lead to improved diagnostic capabilities and open avenues for targeted therapeutic delivery for the treatment of tumors overexpressing CAIX, particularly breast cancer.",

The cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the early stage of the disease (within three months) does not show significant atrophy of the cerebellum and brainstem; 3. presence of either of the following: 1) positive anti-cerebellar antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid cell-based assay (CBA), 2) at least two of the following are present: ① the patient or first-degree relative has a history of autoimmune disease, ② cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes >5×106/L, or positive for cerebrospinal fluid specific oligoclonal bands, ③ tissue-based assay (TBA) revealing the characteristic fluorescent form of Purkinje cell antibody, and ④ the presence of systemic autoimmune disease-related antibodies; and 4. the absence of other diseases. Currently, fewer instances of ACA have been associated with positive results for carbonic anhydrase-related protein VIII (CARP VIII). Three case reports have been detected by this antibody in adults with ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or melanoma, and there is no report on this antibody in children. Moreover, neurological diseases associated with mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are increasingly being reported. Therefore, the correlation between this infection and autoimmune encephalitis antibodies needs to be further investigated.",

In this paper we focus on Carboxypeptidase B1 concentration measurement in dialyzed chronic kidney kidney disease patients and on the effect dialysis adequacy and regimen exert on its concentration. A total of 142 subjects were divided into control and target groups. In the target group two measurements of plasma Carboxypeptidase B1 one month apart were conducted with the use of Carboxypeptidase B1 ELISA kit. The mean Carboxypeptidase B1 concentration was significantly higher in the target arm compared to the control arm (77.60 ± 11.81 ng/mL and 1.22 ± 0.41 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.001). Generalized linear mixed regression revealed that affiliation with the control arm was the only significant contributor of this finding. Linear mixed model regression revealed that dialysis regimen that represents number of dialyses per one week-long cycle is a significant predictor of Carboxypeptidase B1 concentration. Exploration of the estimated marginal means of Carboxypeptidase B1 revealed that the Carboxypeptidase B1 concentration was significantly higher among patients on twice per week dialysis regimen than among those treated with three dialysis sessions per week.",

A six day exposure to a 5 μM PFAS mixture significantly enhanced the malignant progression of HCC in vitro. Metabolomic analysis identified the upregulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a key factor associated with these effects. This hypothesis was further validated using celecoxib, a PGE2 inhibitor, which reduced PGE2 levels in HCC cells, consequently slowing their migration and invasion. Additionally, mice treated with celecoxib exhibited reduced tumor volumes compared with those treated with PFAS alone. These results suggest that PFAS exposure enhances HCC malignancy through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via increased PGE2 production.

In this study, we systematically investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of PFAS mixtures on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells (JHH-7 and Li-7) in vitro using a combination of biological techniques and high-coverage untargeted metabolomics. A six day exposure to a 5 μM PFAS mixture significantly enhanced the malignant progression of HCC in vitro. Metabolomic analysis identified the upregulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a key factor associated with these effects. This hypothesis was further validated using celecoxib, a PGE2 inhibitor, which reduced PGE2 levels in HCC cells, consequently slowing their migration and invasion. Additionally, mice treated with celecoxib exhibited reduced tumor volumes compared with those treated with PFAS alone. These results suggest that PFAS exposure enhances HCC malignancy through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via increased PGE2 production. In conclusion, a 5 μM PFAS mixture accelerates HCC proliferation and invasion; moreover, celecoxib demonstrates potential as a therapeutic agent that inhibits these effects.",

In later years, uptake of iron from complex sources, such as nanoparticles, has been found to be mediated through endocytosis. Here we propose that iron from the simple salt ferrous fumarate, a common iron supplement, can be absorbed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We used siRNA to silence DMT1 transporter expression, pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis, and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to show that iron uptake from ferrous fumarate can be mediated by both transport via DMT1 and by clathrin-dependent endocytosis in Hutu-80 cells. Iron uptake (ferritin L) from ferrous fumarate (0.5 mM, 24 h) in DMT1 silenced cells was significantly decreased (60% ± 11%) in comparison to iron controls while a 1-h dose of ferrous fumarate (0.5 mM) significantly decreased ferritin L formation in the presence of the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine (61% ± 10%, in post-confluent cells and 37% ± 9% in non-confluent cells). A pilot showed a similar trend for Ferritin (H) levels (confluent cells) and for total cellular iron load (non-confluent cells).

Replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs were promoted in C4BPM-overexpressing DF-1 cells with inhibited expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α, IFN-β), protein kinase R (PKR), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) compared to that of the DF-1 cells. However, the replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs in C4BPM-KO DF-1 cells were inhibited with the increased expression of above related anti-viral factors. Further results showed that C4BPM did not affect viral adsorption, while, promote the entry of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs. These results expand the range of host factors regulating replication of AIVs and suggest that C4BPM is a promising target for anti-viral agent.",

After the acute episode, Ctrb1-del × Ctrl-KO mice spontaneously progressed to chronic pancreatitis, whereas C57BL/6N mice recovered rapidly. The cerulein-induced pancreas pathology in Ctrb1-del × Ctrl-KO mice was highly similar to that previously observed in Ctrb1-del mice; however, trypsin activation was more robust and pancreatitis severity was increased. Taken together, the results confirm and extend prior observations demonstrating that chymotrypsin safeguards the pancreas against pancreatitis by limiting pathologic trypsin activity. In mice, the CTRB1 isoform, which constitutes about 90% of the total chymotrypsin content, is responsible primarily for the anti-trypsin defenses and protection against pancreatitis; however, the minor isoform CTRL also contributes to an appreciable extent.",
