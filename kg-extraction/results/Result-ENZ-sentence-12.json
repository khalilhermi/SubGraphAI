We used sensitive sequence similarity searches to expand this large CPBP (CAAX proteases and bacteriocin-processing enzymes) family to include more than 5800 members and infer its homologous relationships to several other protein families, including the PrsW proteases, the DUF2324 (DUF, domain of unknown function) family and the γ-secretase subunit APH-1 proteins. They share four predicted core transmembrane segments and possess similar yet distinct sets of sequence motifs. Remote similarity between APH-1 and membrane proteases sheds light on APH-1's evolutionary origin and raises the possibility that APH-1 may possess proteolytic activity in the current or ancestral form of γ-secretase.",

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on the association between periconception parental conditions and/or modifiable lifestyle factors and an in vivo measure of first trimester growth or development (i.e. crown-rump length, embryonic volume and/or Carnegie stage) between 6 + 0 and 13 + 6 weeks gestational age in singleton pregnancies. Parental conditions and modifiable lifestyle factors were defined as ex utero determinants divided into characteristics (age, ethnicity, BMI, blood pressure), lifestyle risk factors (caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, and smoking), nutrition (dietary patterns and food groups), vitamins (vitamin B9/B11, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and supplements), and the ambient environment (air pollution, noise exposure, and neighborhood deprivation). Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to assess the evidence level of the studies included in the review. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39953705/",

The HHD-associated gene ATPase calcium-transporting type 2C member 1 (ATP2C1) encodes the protein secretory pathway Ca2+ ATPase1 (SPCA1), playing a critical role in HHD pathogenesis. Aims We aimed to investigate the effect of ATP2C1 knockdown on keratinocytes that mimicked acantholysis in HHD. Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to evaluate the levels of cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins such as SPCA1, P-cofilin, F-actin, claudins, occludin, and zonula occludens 1 in the skin biopsies of patients with HHD. Subsequently, the expression of these proteins in cultured ATP2C1 knockdown keratinocytes was analysed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, we assessed the proliferation, apoptosis, and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in the ATP2C1-knocked keratinocytes. Results The results showed decreased levels of these proteins (SPCA1, P-cofilin, F-actin, claudins, occluding, and zonula occludens 1) in HHD skin lesions. Moreover, their levels decreased in human keratinocytes transfected with ATP2C1 short hairpin RNA, accompanied by morphological acantholysis. Furthermore, the proliferation and apoptosis of the keratinocytes, as well as intracellular calcium concentrations in these cells, were not affected. Limitations The limitations of this study are the absence of animal experiments and the failure to explore the relationship between skeletal and tight junction proteins.

The HHD-associated gene ATPase calcium-transporting type 2C member 1 (ATP2C1) encodes the protein secretory pathway Ca2+ ATPase1 (SPCA1), playing a critical role in HHD pathogenesis. Aims We aimed to investigate the effect of ATP2C1 knockdown on keratinocytes that mimicked acantholysis in HHD. Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to evaluate the levels of cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins such as SPCA1, P-cofilin, F-actin, claudins, occludin, and zonula occludens 1 in the skin biopsies of patients with HHD. Subsequently, the expression of these proteins in cultured ATP2C1 knockdown keratinocytes was analysed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, we assessed the proliferation, apoptosis, and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in the ATP2C1-knocked keratinocytes. Results The results showed decreased levels of these proteins (SPCA1, P-cofilin, F-actin, claudins, occluding, and zonula occludens 1) in HHD skin lesions. Moreover, their levels decreased in human keratinocytes transfected with ATP2C1 short hairpin RNA, accompanied by morphological acantholysis. Furthermore, the proliferation and apoptosis of the keratinocytes, as well as intracellular calcium concentrations in these cells, were not affected. Limitations The limitations of this study are the absence of animal experiments and the failure to explore the relationship between skeletal and tight junction proteins. Conclusion The present study indicated that ATP2C1 inhibition led to abnormal levels of the cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins in the keratinocytes. Therefore, keratinocytes can mimic HHD-like acantholysis and serve as an in vitro model, helping develop treatment strategies against HHD.",

Furthermore, we assessed the proliferation, apoptosis, and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in the ATP2C1-knocked keratinocytes. Results The results showed decreased levels of these proteins (SPCA1, P-cofilin, F-actin, claudins, occluding, and zonula occludens 1) in HHD skin lesions. Moreover, their levels decreased in human keratinocytes transfected with ATP2C1 short hairpin RNA, accompanied by morphological acantholysis. Furthermore, the proliferation and apoptosis of the keratinocytes, as well as intracellular calcium concentrations in these cells, were not affected. Limitations The limitations of this study are the absence of animal experiments and the failure to explore the relationship between skeletal and tight junction proteins. Conclusion The present study indicated that ATP2C1 inhibition led to abnormal levels of the cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins in the keratinocytes. Therefore, keratinocytes can mimic HHD-like acantholysis and serve as an in vitro model, helping develop treatment strategies against HHD.",

The median PFS was 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.8) months with ARX788 compared with 8.2 (95% CI, 6.9-8.7) months with LC, as per BICR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, p = 0.0006). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were 98.6% and 99.1% for ARX788 and LC, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 41.4% and 40.0%, respectively, the most common adverse events were blurred vision (12.3%), dry eye (9.1%), keratopathy (5.9%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD, 5.9%) with ARX788; hand-foot syndrome (18.1%) and hypokalemia (5.1%) with LC; all the hematological and gastrointestinal events of grade ≥3 with ARX788 were less than 3%. Six treatment-related deaths occurred, with three cases possibly related to ILD.

Carbamazepine is frequently the first-line treatment, making early prediction of patient response essential for personalized care. This approach helps reduce adverse effects and healthcare costs, while enhancing patient outcomes. This study aims to explore the link between the ABCB1 c.3435C > T genetic variation and Carbamazepine resistance and toxicity in Algerian patients with epilepsy, with a focus on the impact of genetic variations on Carbamazepine plasma concentrations and treatment outcomes. Ninety-eight Algerian patients with epilepsy were recruited and categorized as either drug-responsive or drug-resistant based on their clinical response to CBZ treatment. Genotyping of the ABCB1 c.3435 C > T polymorphism was performed using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method, and CBZ plasma levels were measured to assess its effect on metabolism. Clinical data, including drug response, therapy type, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), were collected and analyzed. For the statistical analysis we used chi-squared tests and Exact Fisher's for corrections. Our findings show no significant association between the ABCB1 c.3435C > T genotypes with carbamazepine resistance (p = 0,1) nor incidence of adverse reactions. This polymorphism also indicated no statistically significant link with Carbamazepine plasma levels.

Here, by using 8-hydroxy-pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (pyranine), a fluorescent dye, as a pH indicator, we show that PSII preparations (∗∗BBYs) from Pisum sativum have a high CA activity (as measured by HCO3- dehydration), which is close to that of highly active CAs. This fluorescence method is new for BBYs giving at least ten times higher activity than the other methods used earlier, as well as being highly sensitive and, thus, more convenient to use for BBYs than any other approach. We show here that the pH range of 5.0-7.5 is optimum for the pyranine measuring system, in general, and this pH range is suitable not only for the CA in BBYs but also for other CAs. Further, the CA activity of BBYs has the following unique properties: (1) low sensitivity to some known, and otherwise, effective CA inhibitors; (2) an opposite pH profile of HCO3- dehydration than observed in other known CAs. These findings indicate that the high CA activity, we have observed, belongs to BBYs, i.e., free of other CAs.

Here, by using 8-hydroxy-pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (pyranine), a fluorescent dye, as a pH indicator, we show that PSII preparations (∗∗BBYs) from Pisum sativum have a high CA activity (as measured by HCO<sub>3</sub>- dehydration), which is close to that of highly active CAs. This fluorescence method is new for BBYs giving at least ten times higher activity than the other methods used earlier, as well as being highly sensitive and, thus, more convenient to use for BBYs than any other approach. We show here that the pH range of 5.0-7.5 is optimum for the pyranine measuring system, in general, and this pH range is suitable not only for the CA in BBYs but also for other CAs. Further, the CA activity of BBYs has the following unique properties: (1) low sensitivity to some known, and otherwise, effective CA inhibitors; (2) an opposite pH profile of HCO<sub>3</sub>- dehydration than observed in other known CAs. These findings indicate that the high CA activity, we have observed, belongs to BBYs, i.e., free of other CAs. At pH 6.5, CA activity of BBYs is shown to be directly correlated with that of photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution.

The present study specifically analyses the distribution of CAIV in female reproductive organs and during early placenta development. Immunostaining for CAIV was performed on female reproductive organs (ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, vagina) of non-pregnant mice and on implantation sites of early pregnancy between 4.5 and 9.5 days post coitum (dpc). Sex typing of embryos was performed by PCR using three separated gene combinations for X- and Y-chromosomes, respectively. Additionally, reproductive outcome of CAIV-deficient mice was determined.

Moreover, the yolk sac epithelium, the trophoblast giant cells and the labyrinthine compartment of the developing hemochorial placenta shows a strong immunostaining for CAIV. In heterozygous mating, the number of CAIV knockout pups is significantly reduced than was to be expected according to the mendelian rules, while homozygous mating of CAIV knockout mice results in a significant reduction of litter size which is mainly due to a reduced number of female mice born. Since at 9.5 dpc the number of female embryos is rather higher than that of males, the observed reduction of female offspring appears to be due to a defect in placentation after 9.5 dpc.

CAIV has been shown to play a role in sperm cell capacitation and regulation of sperm motility and is present in mature murine placentae. The present study specifically analyses the distribution of CAIV in female reproductive organs and during early placenta development. Immunostaining for CAIV was performed on female reproductive organs (ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, vagina) of non-pregnant mice and on implantation sites of early pregnancy between 4.5 and 9.5 days post coitum (dpc). Sex typing of embryos was performed by PCR using three separated gene combinations for X- and Y-chromosomes, respectively. Additionally, reproductive outcome of CAIV-deficient mice was determined. CAIV is largely absent in the female reproductive organs of non-pregnant mice. Immunostaining for CAIV was present in the blastocyst and in consecutive stages of the developing embryo. In the endometrial epithelium distant from the implantation chamber, CAIV is induced from 8.5 dpc onwards. Moreover, the yolk sac epithelium, the trophoblast giant cells and the labyrinthine compartment of the developing hemochorial placenta shows a strong immunostaining for CAIV. In heterozygous mating, the number of CAIV knockout pups is significantly reduced than was to be expected according to the mendelian rules, while homozygous mating of CAIV knockout mice results in a significant reduction of litter size which is mainly due to a reduced number of female mice born. Since at 9.5 dpc the number of female embryos is rather higher than that of males, the observed reduction of female offspring appears to be due to a defect in placentation after 9.5 dpc. Thus, CAIV seems to be involved in the signaling network of embryo development, implantation, and placentation.",

Here, by using 8-hydroxy-pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (pyranine), a fluorescent dye, as a pH indicator, we show that PSII preparations (∗∗BBYs) from Pisum sativum have a high CA activity (as measured by HCO3- dehydration), which is close to that of highly active CAs. This fluorescence method is new for BBYs giving at least ten times higher activity than the other methods used earlier, as well as being highly sensitive and, thus, more convenient to use for BBYs than any other approach. We show here that the pH range of 5.0-7.5 is optimum for the pyranine measuring system, in general, and this pH range is suitable not only for the CA in BBYs but also for other CAs. Further, the CA activity of BBYs has the following unique properties: (1) low sensitivity to some known, and otherwise, effective CA inhibitors; (2) an opposite pH profile of HCO3- dehydration than observed in other known CAs. These findings indicate that the high CA activity, we have observed, belongs to BBYs, i.e., free of other CAs.

In this paper we focus on Carboxypeptidase B1 concentration measurement in dialyzed chronic kidney kidney disease patients and on the effect dialysis adequacy and regimen exert on its concentration. A total of 142 subjects were divided into control and target groups. In the target group two measurements of plasma Carboxypeptidase B1 one month apart were conducted with the use of Carboxypeptidase B1 ELISA kit. The mean Carboxypeptidase B1 concentration was significantly higher in the target arm compared to the control arm (77.60 ± 11.81 ng/mL and 1.22 ± 0.41 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.001). Generalized linear mixed regression revealed that affiliation with the control arm was the only significant contributor of this finding. Linear mixed model regression revealed that dialysis regimen that represents number of dialyses per one week-long cycle is a significant predictor of Carboxypeptidase B1 concentration.

A six day exposure to a 5 μM PFAS mixture significantly enhanced the malignant progression of HCC in vitro. Metabolomic analysis identified the upregulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a key factor associated with these effects. This hypothesis was further validated using celecoxib, a PGE2 inhibitor, which reduced PGE2 levels in HCC cells, consequently slowing their migration and invasion. Additionally, mice treated with celecoxib exhibited reduced tumor volumes compared with those treated with PFAS alone. These results suggest that PFAS exposure enhances HCC malignancy through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via increased PGE2 production.

Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to a 1:1 ratio to an intervention group (compound reserpine and triamterene tablets) or a control group (valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide). The primary outcome will be mean changes from baseline in 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP after intervention for 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes have been predetermined and will primarily encompass the following: (1) changes in other BP measures, as well as changes in blood lipids, blood glucose and uric acid at 12 weeks and (2) evaluation of the impact of starting antihypertensive therapy with compound reserpine and triamterene tablets or valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide on the depressive and anxiety statess of patients. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39920071/",

In later years, uptake of iron from complex sources, such as nanoparticles, has been found to be mediated through endocytosis. Here we propose that iron from the simple salt ferrous fumarate, a common iron supplement, can be absorbed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We used siRNA to silence DMT1 transporter expression, pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis, and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to show that iron uptake from ferrous fumarate can be mediated by both transport via DMT1 and by clathrin-dependent endocytosis in Hutu-80 cells. Iron uptake (ferritin L) from ferrous fumarate (0.5 mM, 24 h) in DMT1 silenced cells was significantly decreased (60% ± 11%) in comparison to iron controls while a 1-h dose of ferrous fumarate (0.5 mM) significantly decreased ferritin L formation in the presence of the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine (61% ± 10%, in post-confluent cells and 37% ± 9% in non-confluent cells). A pilot showed a similar trend for Ferritin (H) levels (confluent cells) and for total cellular iron load (non-confluent cells). ToF-SIMS analysis revealed diminished membrane-associated iron load in endocytosis-inhibited ferrous fumarate treated cells. The reported results support a clathrin-mediated endocytosis mechanism for uptake of iron from ferrous fumarate in addition to iron uptake by DMT1.

Host factors play a key role in the replication of AIVs, while the function of complement component 4 binding protein, membrane (C4BPM) in this process is still unclear. This research reports that C4BPM promotes replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs by inhibiting type I interferons (IFNs). H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs infection up-regulate the expression of C4BPM in chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1). To verify the role of C4BPM in replication of AIVs, C4BPM knockout (C4BPM-KO) and stable overexpressing (C4BPM-overexpressing) DF-1 cells were generated using lentivirus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology and molecular cloning strategies. Replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs were promoted in C4BPM-overexpressing DF-1 cells with inhibited expression of type I IFNs (IFN-α, IFN-β), protein kinase R (PKR), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) compared to that of the DF-1 cells. However, the replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs in C4BPM-KO DF-1 cells were inhibited with the increased expression of above related anti-viral factors. Further results showed that C4BPM did not affect viral adsorption, while, promote the entry of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs. These results expand the range of host factors regulating replication of AIVs and suggest that C4BPM is a promising target for anti-viral agent.",

Further results showed that C4BPM did not affect viral adsorption, while, promote the entry of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs. These results expand the range of host factors regulating replication of AIVs and suggest that C4BPM is a promising target for anti-viral agent.",

Studying resistance that develops during the treatment of an infection can provide the most clinically relevant mutations conferring resistance, but cross-sectional studies frequently identify multiple candidate resistance mutations without resolving the driver mutation. We performed whole-genome sequencing of longitudinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a patient whose P. aeruginosa developed imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance during ceftazidime/avibactam treatment. This analysis determined new mutations that arose in isolates resistant to both imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam. Mutations in penicillin-binding protein 3 ftsI, the MexAB-OprM repressor nalD, and a virulence regulator pvdS were found in resistant isolates. Importantly, drug efflux was not increased in the resistant isolate compared to the most closely related susceptible isolates. We conclude that mutations in peptidoglycan synthesis genes can alter the efficacy of multiple antimicrobials.",
