            "source": "39889669: The piezo-photocatalysis enhanced by piezoelectric nanogenerators is considered one of the most effective methods for treating emerging contaminants (ECs) in environmental water. In this study, BiFeO<sub>3</sub>/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/Ag (BFO/ZIS/Ag) with boosting piezo-photocatalytic performance was synthesized by modulating the interaction between the step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction and the Mott-Schottky barrier. The catalytic rate of the optimized BFO/ZIS/Ag-0.01 catalyst is 4.85 × 10-2 min-1 for the degradation of niazitidine (NZT) under both ultrasonic and visible light radiation, which is respectively 4.3 and 4.8 times higher than that of pure BFO and ZIS. Furthermore, the total organic carbon (TOC) test revealed that NZT degradation reached 98.4 % after 120 min of continuous reaction. This enhanced piezo-photocatalytic performance is mainly due to the synergistic effect of integrated heterojunction and piezoelectric field. DFT calculations revealed that the charge transfer enhancement at the heterogeneous interface resulted from directional electron transfer to ZIS via Zn-O and S-Ag channels, following the introduction of Ag nanoparticles, which shortened the carrier separation path. Additionally, BFO bent the band of the composite catalyst, promoting carrier separation. These resulted in the generation of abundant highly active 1O<sub>2</sub>, which specifically targeted and disrupted stable NZT molecules. Moreover, BFO/ZIS/Ag-0.01 exhibited strong inhibitory and antibacterial effects against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus via electrostatic adsorption and ionization.

            "source": "39889669: The piezo-photocatalysis enhanced by piezoelectric nanogenerators is considered one of the most effective methods for treating emerging contaminants (ECs) in environmental water. In this study, BiFeO<sub>3</sub>/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/Ag (BFO/ZIS/Ag) with boosting piezo-photocatalytic performance was synthesized by modulating the interaction between the step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction and the Mott-Schottky barrier. The catalytic rate of the optimized BFO/ZIS/Ag-0.01 catalyst is 4.85 × 10-2 min-1 for the degradation of niazitidine (NZT) under both ultrasonic and visible light radiation, which is respectively 4.3 and 4.8 times higher than that of pure BFO and ZIS. Furthermore, the total organic carbon (TOC) test revealed that NZT degradation reached 98.4 % after 120 min of continuous reaction. This enhanced piezo-photocatalytic performance is mainly due to the synergistic effect of integrated heterojunction and piezoelectric field. DFT calculations revealed that the charge transfer enhancement at the heterogeneous interface resulted from directional electron transfer to ZIS via Zn-O and S-Ag channels, following the introduction of Ag nanoparticles, which shortened the carrier separation path. Additionally, BFO bent the band of the composite catalyst, promoting carrier separation. These resulted in the generation of abundant highly active 1O<sub>2</sub>, which specifically targeted and disrupted stable NZT molecules. Moreover, BFO/ZIS/Ag-0.01 exhibited strong inhibitory and antibacterial effects against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus via electrostatic adsorption and ionization.

However, the majority of current data comes from pre-marketing, with limited real-world studies. Our research aimed to explore post-marketing data of avapritinib. We evaluated the signals of avapritinib-related neuropsychiatric AEs by data mining using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were employed to quantify the signals from the first quarter of 2020 through the fourth quarter of 2023. Subsequently, stratified analyses were conducted to further explore the effect of different stratification schemes on the association between avapritinib and neuropsychiatric AEs. Finally, a combination medication analysis was conducted to explore the impact of the co-administration of neuropsychiatric AEs. A total of 2029 neuropsychiatric AEs were reported, and 49 signals were detected, of which 5 were determined to be new signals. Avapritinib was significantly associated with the occurrence of neuropsychiatric AEs (ROR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.44-1.61; IC: 0.43, IC<sub>025</sub>: 0.35). The stratified analysis found that gender, age and eight preferred terms (PTs), including cerebral haemorrhage, may affect the severity of AEs. Combination medication analysis showed that combining avapritinib with 19 other medications, including prochlorperazine, may increase the risk of neuropsychiatric AEs. The median time-to-onset (TTO) of avapritinib-related neuropsychiatric AEs was 32 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-200) days, with about 65% of cases occurring within the first three months of treatment. An increase in the signal for neuropsychiatric AEs was identified in post-marketing studies of avapritinib. Clinicians are advised to remain vigilant for such events, particularly during the initial stages of treatment with avapritinib. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39856211/",

Elevation in cAMP triggers intracellular signalling events and regulates a wide variety of cellular activities. Thus, we evaluated the effects of Iloprost on platelet function and apoptosis and in vivo haemostasis and thrombosis, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Firstly, we showed that Iloprost concentration-dependently inhibited agonist-induced P-selectin exposure, integrin αIIbβ3 activation, platelet aggregation, ATP release, platelet spreading, and clot retraction. Moreover, Iloprost dose-dependently inhibited FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced mouse mesenteric arteriole thrombosis and markedly prolonged the tail bleeding time. Iloprost also concentration-dependently inhibited mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) depolarisation and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalisation in platelets, thereby inhibiting platelet apoptosis, and Iloprost at concentrations lower than 2 nM inhibited only platelet apoptosis but not platelet function. Importantly, Iloprost at low doses markedly elevated peripheral platelet counts in GPIbα antibody-induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Mechanistic studies showed that Iloprost concentration-dependently antagonised agonist-induced decline of protein kinase A (PKA) activity and elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in platelets, thereby attenuating platelet activation and aggregation. Elevation in PKA activity inhibited dephosphorylation of proapoptotic protein BAD and reduced caspase-3 activity, thus retarding platelet apoptosis. These data demonstrate that Iloprost dose-dependently inhibits platelet function and apoptosis by elevating PKA activity. Moderate-dose Iloprost impairs haemostasis and thrombosis via suppression of platelet function, and low-dose Iloprost elevates peripheral platelet levels by inhibiting platelet apoptosis while having no effects on platelet function. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39929746/",
