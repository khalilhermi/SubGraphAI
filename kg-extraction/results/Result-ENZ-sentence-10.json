Genomic analysis using high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) identified a novel splice site deletion (c.562+4_562+7del) in the LMBRD1 gene resulting in Cbl deficiency. cDNA sequencing elucidated exon 6 skipping as a consequence of a novel deletion, resulting in significant structural alterations of LMBD1 protein, which was further validated by in-silico computational analysis.

To identify targets and target-modulating small molecules that enhance HbF expression, we engineered a human umbilical-derived erythroid progenitor reporter cell line (HUDEP2_HBG1_HiBiT) by genetically tagging a HiBiT peptide to the carboxyl (C)-terminus of the endogenous HBG1 gene locus, which codes for γ-globin protein, a component of HbF. Employing this reporter cell line, we performed a chemogenomic screen of approximately 5000 compounds annotated with known targets or mechanisms that have achieved clinical stage or approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Among them, 10 compounds were confirmed for their ability to induce HbF in the HUDEP2 cell line. These include several known HbF inducers, such as pomalidomide, lenalidomide, decitabine, idoxuridine, and azacytidine, which validate the translational nature of this screening platform. We identified avadomide, autophinib, triciribine, and R574 as novel HbF inducers from these screens. We orthogonally confirmed HbF induction activities of the top hits in both parental HUDEP2 cells as well as in human primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Further, we demonstrated that pomalidomide and avadomide, but not idoxuridine, induced HbF expression through downregulation of several transcriptional repressors such as BCL11A, ZBTB7A, and IKZF1. These studies demonstrate a robust phenotypic screening workflow that can be applied to large-scale small molecule profiling campaigns for the discovery of targets and pathways, as well as novel therapeutics for sickle cell disease and other β-hemoglobinopathies.",

(2) To suppress the mutant EGFR directly. After the virtual screening of a newly designed series of hybrid models, selected molecules were synthesized and well-characterized from various spectroscopic and spectrometric methods. The critical analysis and chemistry behind the structural interactions of the selected compounds with three target sites were discussed i.e., inactive EGFR (PDB code: 1XKK), mutant EGFR (PDB code: 3W2O), and allosteric site of mutant EGFR (PDB code: 6P1L).

Whereas, compound 8 exhibited all the above-mentioned features excellently against mutant EGFR. Apart from that, the investigations were expanded to study the structural behaviour in the allosteric site, where compound 8 once again performed effectively.

            "source": "Lysosomes are the major cellular organelles responsible for nutrient recycling and degradation of cellular material. Maintenance of lysosomal integrity is essential for cellular homeostasis and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) sensitizes toward cell death. Damaged lysosomes are repaired or degraded via lysophagy, during which glycans, exposed on ruptured lysosomal membranes, are recognized by galectins leading to K48- and K63-linked poly-ubiquitination (poly-Ub) of lysosomal proteins followed by recruitment of the macroautophagic/autophagic machinery and degradation. Linear (M1) poly-Ub, catalyzed by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) E3 ligase and removed by OTULIN (OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity) exerts important functions in immune signaling and cell survival, but the role of M1 poly-Ub in lysosomal homeostasis remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that L-leucyl-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe)-damaged lysosomes accumulate M1 poly-Ub in an OTULIN- and K63 Ub-dependent manner. LMP-induced M1 poly-Ub at damaged lysosomes contributes to lysosome degradation, recruits the NFKB (nuclear factor kappa B) modulator IKBKG/NEMO and locally activates the inhibitor of NFKB kinase (IKK) complex to trigger NFKB activation. Inhibition of lysosomal degradation enhances LMP- and OTULIN-regulated cell death, indicating pro-survival functions of M1 poly-Ub during LMP and potentially lysophagy. Finally, we demonstrate that M1 poly-Ub also occurs at damaged lysosomes in primary mouse neurons and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived primary human dopaminergic neurons. Our results reveal novel functions of M1 poly-Ub during lysosomal homeostasis, LMP and degradation of damaged lysosomes, with important implications for NFKB signaling, inflammation and cell death.",

Increasing evidence has demonstrated a strong correlation between inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKBKE) and cancer progression as well as drug resistance.

This study examines the molecular mechanisms underlying stem reserve utilization by conducting a comparative analysis of the proteome and metabolome across three barley contrasting genotypes: Yousef, Morocco, and PBYT17. Evaluations were performed at 21 and 28 days after anthesis (DAA) under both water stress and control conditions. The results indicate that the Yousef genotype exhibits superior remobilization of stem reserves, thereby demonstrating its potential to thrive even in adverse environmental conditions. Utilizing advanced quantitative proteomics and targeted metabolomics, this investigation identified a significant number of metabolites and proteins exhibiting differential accumulation across the genotypes. Specifically, 17 metabolites and 1580 proteins were catalogued, highlighting the intricate biochemical responses to water stress. Noteworthy enzymes such as sucrose synthase, inositol monophosphatase 3, and galactokinase were found to be closely associated with remobilization efficiency. In the drought-tolerant genotype, these enzymes maintained stable levels, in stark contrast to the decline observed in the susceptible genotype. This stability is crucial for promoting seed development through ascorbic acid synthesis and for mitigating oxidative stress, which is exacerbated by drought conditions. The elevated levels of certain metabolites, including glucose 6-phosphate, and UDP-glucose, in the drought-tolerant genotype suggest a robust mechanism for maintaining signalling molecules for carbon availability, which is then instrumental in regulating plant growth and seed size development. The findings from this study strongly imply that the drought-tolerant genotype, through enhanced antioxidant capacity, can effectively produce energy-rich storage compounds, thereby optimizing carbon allocation under water stress. Such insights are invaluable for future breeding strategies aimed at improving barley resilience in the face of climate variability.",

            "source": "The remobilization of stored assimilates from stems to seeds plays a pivotal role in augmenting barley yield, particularly under water stress conditions. This study examines the molecular mechanisms underlying stem reserve utilization by conducting a comparative analysis of the proteome and metabolome across three barley contrasting genotypes: Yousef, Morocco, and PBYT17. Evaluations were performed at 21 and 28 days after anthesis (DAA) under both water stress and control conditions. The results indicate that the Yousef genotype exhibits superior remobilization of stem reserves, thereby demonstrating its potential to thrive even in adverse environmental conditions. Utilizing advanced quantitative proteomics and targeted metabolomics, this investigation identified a significant number of metabolites and proteins exhibiting differential accumulation across the genotypes. Specifically, 17 metabolites and 1580 proteins were catalogued, highlighting the intricate biochemical responses to water stress. Noteworthy enzymes such as sucrose synthase, inositol monophosphatase 3, and galactokinase were found to be closely associated with remobilization efficiency. In the drought-tolerant genotype, these enzymes maintained stable levels, in stark contrast to the decline observed in the susceptible genotype. This stability is crucial for promoting seed development through ascorbic acid synthesis and for mitigating oxidative stress, which is exacerbated by drought conditions. The elevated levels of certain metabolites, including glucose 6-phosphate, and UDP-glucose, in the drought-tolerant genotype suggest a robust mechanism for maintaining signalling molecules for carbon availability, which is then instrumental in regulating plant growth and seed size development. The findings from this study strongly imply that the drought-tolerant genotype, through enhanced antioxidant capacity, can effectively produce energy-rich storage compounds, thereby optimizing carbon allocation under water stress. Such insights are invaluable for future breeding strategies aimed at improving barley resilience in the face of climate variability.",

Unfortunately, acquired FOLFIRI resistance represents a common obstacle in the treatment of mCRC patients. Thus, we aimed to identify mechanisms, gene alterations and gene expression signatures contributing to acquired FOLFIRI resistance by mimicking this problem in a cell culture model and subsequent translation in clinical datasets. Three FOLFIRI resistant CRC cell lines were established by continuous FOLFIRI treatment. Comparative mutation screening (161 genes) and transcriptomics (pathway and differential expression analyses) were performed in parental and resistant cells. Data reconciliation was performed in GSE62322, a clinical FOLFIRI responder dataset (intrinsic resistance). Relapse-free survival (RFS) associations of identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and potential gene signatures were investigated in eight clinical CRC datasets. No mutual genetic alterations were found in FOLFIRI resistant derivatives. Resistant cell lines displayed activation of MAPK, immune response and EMT pathways. 12 DEGs, significantly differentially expressed in at least two of the three resistant cell lines, were identified. Comparison with GSE62322 and subsequent survival analyses revealed a five-gene FOLFIRI signature comprised of CAV2, TNC, TACSTD2, SERPINE2, and PERP that was associated with RFS in multiple datasets including TCGA CRC (Hazard ratio (HR)=2.634, p=4.53x10-6), in pooled samples of all datasets (all stages (N=1981): HR=1.852, p=6.44x10-13; stage IV (N=260): HR=2.462, p=5.22x10-9).

With recent pharmacological studies showing the potential antidepressant properties of X. americana extract, this study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of the compound(s) isolated from X. americana extract using the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) models predictive of depression. The extracts, administered orally within a dose range of 100-400 mg/kg, notably decreased the immobility time in both the FST and the TST. The most significant reduction occurred at the highest dose of 400 mg/kg, with a decrease of 117.66 s in FST and 53.5 s in TST. However, this reduction in immobility was not linked to changes in movements, as observed in an open-field test (OFT), suggesting that the effect of the extracts was not due to activation of locomotion. Subsequently, a sesquiterpene lactone, dehydrocostus lactone (1) was isolated through solubility-based fractionation and column chromatography of the active root bark extract of X. americana. Dehydrocostus lactone (400 mg/kg) demonstrated a 46.50 s reduction in immobility time in the FST, which was comparable to the positive control, imipramine (30 mg/kg). With a highly favorable docking score of -8.365 kcal/mol on an antidepressant target, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A; pdb ID: 2BXS), dehydrocostus lactone (1) potentially outperforms the standard MAO-A inhibitor drug, isocarboxazid (-5.847 kcal/mol). Dehydrocostus lactone (1) displayed strong interactions involving hydrogen bond and hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with specific MAO-A binding site residues. These findings highlight that the antidepressant-like activity of X. americana is partly attributed to the presence of dehydrocostus lactone. Additionally, it also supports the traditional medicinal use of the plant for treating depression.",

Survivors often develop long-term neurological consequences, including spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and impaired cognition. Numerous studies implicate OP-induced neuroinflammation as a pathogenic mechanism contributing to these chronic sequelae; however, little is known about the inflammatory phenotype of innate immune cells in the brain following acute OP intoxication. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the natural history of microglial and astrocytic inflammatory phenotypes following acute intoxication with the OP, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single dose of DFP (4 mg/kg, sc) followed by standard medical countermeasures. Within minutes, animals developed benzodiazepine-resistant SE as determined by monitoring seizures using a modified Racine scale. At 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 d post-exposure (DPE), neuroinflammation was assessed using translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In both sexes, we observed consistently elevated radiotracer uptake across all examined brain regions and time points. A separate group of animals was euthanized at these same time points to collect tissues for immunohistochemical analyses. Colocalization of IBA-1, a marker for microglia, with iNOS or Arg1 was used to identify pro- and anti-inflammatory microglia, respectively; colocalization of GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, with C3 or S100A10, pro- and anti-inflammatory astrocytes, respectively. We observed shifts in the inflammatory profiles of microglia and astrocyte populations during the first month post-intoxication, largely in hyperintense inflammatory lesions in the piriform cortex and amygdala regions. In these areas, iNOS+ proinflammatory microglial cell density peaked at 3 and 7 DPE, while anti-inflammatory Arg1+ microglia cell density peaked at 14 DPE. Pro- and anti-inflammatory astrocytes emerged within 7 DPE, and roughly equal ratios of C3+ pro-inflammatory and S100A10+ anti-inflammatory astrocytes persisted at 28 DPE. In summary, microglia and astrocytes adopted mixed inflammatory phenotypes post-OP intoxication, which evolved over one month post exposure. These activated cell populations were most prominent in the piriform and amygdala areas and were more abundant in males compared to females. The temporal relationship between microglial and astrocytic responses suggests that initial microglial activity may influence delayed, persistent astrocytic responses.

Within minutes, animals developed benzodiazepine-resistant SE as determined by monitoring seizures using a modified Racine scale. At 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 d post-exposure (DPE), neuroinflammation was assessed using translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In both sexes, we observed consistently elevated radiotracer uptake across all examined brain regions and time points. A separate group of animals was euthanized at these same time points to collect tissues for immunohistochemical analyses. Colocalization of IBA-1, a marker for microglia, with iNOS or Arg1 was used to identify pro- and anti-inflammatory microglia, respectively; colocalization of GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, with C3 or S100A10, pro- and anti-inflammatory astrocytes, respectively. We observed shifts in the inflammatory profiles of microglia and astrocyte populations during the first month post-intoxication, largely in hyperintense inflammatory lesions in the piriform cortex and amygdala regions. In these areas, iNOS+ proinflammatory microglial cell density peaked at 3 and 7 DPE, while anti-inflammatory Arg1+ microglia cell density peaked at 14 DPE. Pro- and anti-inflammatory astrocytes emerged within 7 DPE, and roughly equal ratios of C3+ pro-inflammatory and S100A10+ anti-inflammatory astrocytes persisted at 28 DPE. In summary, microglia and astrocytes adopted mixed inflammatory phenotypes post-OP intoxication, which evolved over one month post exposure. These activated cell populations were most prominent in the piriform and amygdala areas and were more abundant in males compared to females. The temporal relationship between microglial and astrocytic responses suggests that initial microglial activity may influence delayed, persistent astrocytic responses. Further, our findings identify putative windows for inhibition of OP-induced neuroinflammatory responses in both sexes to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of anti-inflammation in this context.",

It is hypothesized that inflammation is a driver of these pathological changes. It has previously been identified that routine treatment at first and subsequent calving and lameness events with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was important in reducing the future risk of lameness in dairy heifers. The impact NSAID administration has on lameness outcomes for multiparous dairy cattle is unknown. We conducted a 34mo randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of routine administration of the NSAID ketoprofen during treatment for lameness and at calving, on the future probability of lameness and culling, caused by exposure to normal farm conditions. Dairy cattle that had calved at least once were recruited from a single herd, and randomly allocated to one of 4 treatments while controlling for parity, proportion of occasions scored as lame 8wks before study onset, and days in milk. All lactating animals were lameness scored every 2wk, to identify lame animals requiring treatment. Animals in Group 1 received a therapeutic trim and an orthopedic hoof block (if deemed necessary) every time they were treated for lameness. Animals in Group 2 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily), alongside the same treatment as Group 1 every time they were treated for lameness. Animals in Group 3 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily) starting 24 to 36 h after each calving, alongside the same treatment as Group 2 for lameness. Animals in Group 4 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily) every time they were identified with lameness, with no therapeutic trim, unless they were identified as severely lame (a single score ≥ 3a). Animals were followed for the 34mo duration of the study. Independent lameness outcome scores were collected every 2wks by technicians who were blinded to Treatment Group to assess the probability of lameness. Culling data were extracted from farm records. A total of 425 animals were recruited to the study (105 in Group 1, 107 in Group 2, 107 in Group 3 and 106 in Group 4), with data from 412 animals included in the final analysis (n = 102 Group 1, 102 Group 2, 106 Group 3, and 102 Group 4). The effect of Treatment Group on the ongoing probability of lameness was evaluated through the use of mixed effect, logistic regression models. Compared with animals in Group 1, animals in Group 4 were significantly more likely to be identified as lame throughout the study period. No effect on the risk of severe lameness was identified. The effect of Group on time to culling was investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model. No benefit of NSAID or hoof trimming intervention on culling risk was identified. Our results highlight the importance of frequent therapeutic trimming and the application of orthopedic blocks in the treatment of lameness in multiparous animals that may have a history of calving and lameness without NSAID administration.",

            "source": "Hoof horn lesions are recurrent in nature and cause long-term pathological challenges to the functional anatomy of the hoof in dairy cattle. It is hypothesized that inflammation is a driver of these pathological changes. It has previously been identified that routine treatment at first and subsequent calving and lameness events with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was important in reducing the future risk of lameness in dairy heifers. The impact NSAID administration has on lameness outcomes for multiparous dairy cattle is unknown. We conducted a 34mo randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of routine administration of the NSAID ketoprofen during treatment for lameness and at calving, on the future probability of lameness and culling, caused by exposure to normal farm conditions. Dairy cattle that had calved at least once were recruited from a single herd, and randomly allocated to one of 4 treatments while controlling for parity, proportion of occasions scored as lame 8wks before study onset, and days in milk. All lactating animals were lameness scored every 2wk, to identify lame animals requiring treatment. Animals in Group 1 received a therapeutic trim and an orthopedic hoof block (if deemed necessary) every time they were treated for lameness. Animals in Group 2 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily), alongside the same treatment as Group 1 every time they were treated for lameness. Animals in Group 3 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily) starting 24 to 36 h after each calving, alongside the same treatment as Group 2 for lameness. Animals in Group 4 received a 3-d course of ketoprofen (single dose daily) every time they were identified with lameness, with no therapeutic trim, unless they were identified as severely lame (a single score ≥ 3a). Animals were followed for the 34mo duration of the study. Independent lameness outcome scores were collected every 2wks by technicians who were blinded to Treatment Group to assess the probability of lameness. Culling data were extracted from farm records. A total of 425 animals were recruited to the study (105 in Group 1, 107 in Group 2, 107 in Group 3 and 106 in Group 4), with data from 412 animals included in the final analysis (n = 102 Group 1, 102 Group 2, 106 Group 3, and 102 Group 4). The effect of Treatment Group on the ongoing probability of lameness was evaluated through the use of mixed effect, logistic regression models. Compared with animals in Group 1, animals in Group 4 were significantly more likely to be identified as lame throughout the study period. No effect on the risk of severe lameness was identified. The effect of Group on time to culling was investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model. No benefit of NSAID or hoof trimming intervention on culling risk was identified. Our results highlight the importance of frequent therapeutic trimming and the application of orthopedic blocks in the treatment of lameness in multiparous animals that may have a history of calving and lameness without NSAID administration.",

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed well-defined tips and morphology, and in vitro studies showed a controlled 93% cumulative release over 72 h, with a zero-order kinetic release profile, providing stable therapeutic levels. Pharmacodynamic evaluation using the Ovalbumin/Aluminium hydroxide-induced AC model demonstrated significant reductions in IgE, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels by 68.7%, 71.3%, and 67.6%, respectively, while TGF-β and IL-10 levels increased by 70.1% and 62.7% using ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). Gene expression analysis (IGF-1, Annexin A1, and Bcl2) further supported the therapeutic potential of this system. In this study, we proved the topical application of the multiple strategies approach KF-SP loaded PVA/PVP MNs patch offers a targeted, sustained release treatment for AC, with promising implications for prolonged ocular therapy.",

This research aimed to explore the role of histone 3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18lac) in NAFLD progression using a high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mouse model and free fatty acids (FFA)-treated L-02 cell lines. Lipids accumulation was screened via Oil Red O staining, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), western blotting, and commercially available kits. Similarly, molecular mechanism was analyzed using immunoprecipitation (IP), dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA decay assay. Results indicated that FFA upregulated lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and H3K18lac levels in L-02 cells. Besides, LDHA-mediated H3K18lac was enriched on the proximal promoter of methyltransferase 3 (METTL3), translating into an increased expression. Moreover, METTL3 or LDHA knockdown relieved lipid accumulation, decreased total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels, and downregulated lipogenesis-related proteins in FFA-treated L-02 cell lines, in addition to enhancing the m6A and mRNA levels of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1). The m6A modification of SCD1 was recognized by YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F1 (YTHDF1), resulting in enhanced mRNA stability. LDHA was found to be highly expressed in HFD-treated mice, where knocking down LDHA attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. These findings demonstrated that LDHA-induced H3K18lac promoted NAFLD progression, where LDHA-induced H3K18lac in METTL3 promoter elevated METTL3 expression, thereby promoting m6A methylation and stabilizing SCD1 via a YTHDF1-dependent manner.
