To evaluate the membrane responses to olanzapine, imipramine, desipramine, amitriptyline, lidocaine, and dibucaine, we examined the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine liposomes.

The experimental results showed that the bilayer hydrogel loaded with 50 µg/mL of Cur (GACCur50) had excellent antibacterial properties and high antioxidative activity with a 54.35 ± 0.48% DPPH scavenging ratio. In addition, this GACCur50 bilayer hydrogel exhibited the capacity to mitigate the polarization of inflammatory cells toward pro-inflammatory states, observably reducing the expression of pertinent pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the bilayer hydrogel dressing also showed good biocompatibility as assessed by live-dead fluorescent staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and CCK-8 test. Therefore, the GACCur50 bilayer hydrogel dressing is promising for wound healing.",

Thirteen studies focused on GI motility using objective tests, eight assessed clinical responses, and six evaluated both. Cisapride (n = 5 studies), Metoclopramide (n = 7 studies), Octreotide (n = 4 studies), and Prucalopride (n = 1 study) were among the most studied prokinetics, with varying effects on different GI anatomical regions. While Metoclopramide consistently improved overall GI motility, other prokinetics provided selective benefits; Cisapride improved gastric emptying and colonic motility, but not esophageal motility, and Octreotide improved small bowel motility but delayed gastric emptying. Regarding symptomatic improvement, only prucalopride was evaluated using a validated patient questionnaire, showing improvement in both upper and lower GI symptoms. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39909554/",

            "source": "39945506: A sedentary lifestyle can lead to motor and cognitive deficits, increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases in ageing. Emerging hypotheses suggest that these functional alterations may be related to energy metabolism. Indeed, ATP produced by mitochondria is essential for muscle contraction, neurotransmission and brain plasticity processes. Although a sedentary lifestyle has been associated with mitochondrial alterations in skeletal muscle, the potential effects on brain structures have yet to be investigated. The present study aimed to determine whether early sensorimotor restriction (SMR) alters mitochondrial metabolism in rat muscles and brain structures. Enzyme activities of citrate synthase (CS) and respiratory chain complexes I, II and IV were measured using a spectrophotometric technique and mitochondrial respiration was assessed using high-resolution respirometry in two hind limb muscles [soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL)] and four brain structures (sensorimotor cortex, striatum, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) in control rats and rats experiencing early SMR from birth to day 28. Mitochondrial enzyme activities decreased in the soleus (complexes I and II), in the EDL (complex I) and in the hippocampus (complexes I and IV) in an age-dependent manner, whereas no effect was observed in other brain structures. CS activity decreases in the soleus and increases transiently in the striatum and sensorimotor cortex at postnatal day 15. Mitochondrial respiration was reduced in the soleus and in the sensorimotor cortex (CI and CI+CII). Early SMR appears to induce quantitative and qualitative mitochondrial alterations in skeletal muscles and certain brain structures involved in cognitive and motor processes. KEY POINTS: Early sensorimotor restriction (SMR) alters mitochondrial enzyme activities and mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscles and brain. Mitochondrial alterations induced by early SMR are age-dependent, structure-dependent and complex-dependent.

These therapeutic benefits are hypothesized to result from the promotion of neuroplasticity, particularly when administered during the acute phase of injury. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemogenetic stimulation using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in conjunction with clozapine, a ligand for receptor activation. DREADDs enable targeted, reversible neuromodulation, facilitating the histological characterization of engineered neurons. We utilized these receptors to modulate G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, leading to the activation or inhibition of intracellular signaling. The objective was to determine whether the administration of DREADDs and clozapine (0.1 ​mg/kg) could enhance motor function and neuronal recovery, particularly when applied during the acute phase of SCI. Weekly behavioral assessments demonstrated significant improvements in motor skills and neuronal regeneration in treated animals compared to controls, with the most pronounced effects observed when stimulation was initiated early after injury. These enhancements in neuroplasticity were reflected in improved ladder rung test scores and Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale results in DREADDs-treated rats. Histological analyses, including immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, Western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), confirmed that the treatment group exhibited a higher density of neurons, increased signaling protein expression, and reduced inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that chemogenetic stimulation, particularly when administered during the acute phase, effectively promotes neuroregeneration and motor recovery.

Understanding the mechanisms behind CSCs generation and stemness maintenance is vital for early cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, we unveil that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is highly expressed in ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) and is essential for maintaining stemness by regulating lipid desaturation. Studies confirmed that CPT1A enhances SREBP1 activation, upregulating SCD1 expression, and promoting lipid desaturation in OCSCs. Mechanistic studies reveal that CPT1A promotes succinylation of mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) through its lysine succinyltransferase (LSTase) activity, crucial for mitochondria-associated membranes formation and SREBP1 activation. Inhibiting CPT1A's LSTase activity with Glyburide reduces OCSCs' stemness and enhances cisplatin's anti-tumor effects against ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Together, our studies highlight the significance of CPT1A's LSTase activity in maintaining OCSCs' stemness, offering potential targets and therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer treatment.",

Rhodibalamins, the rhodium analogs of cobalamins, have been described as antimetabolites due to their ability to inhibit bacterial growth. In this study, we have examined the reactivity of adenosylrhodibalamin (AdoRhbl) with two key human chaperones, MMACHC (also known as CblC) and adenosyltransferase (MMAB, also known as ATR), and with the human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MMUT. We demonstrate that while AdoRhbl binds tightly to all four proteins, the Rh-carbon bond is resistant to homolytic (on MMAB and MMUT) as well as heterolytic (on MMACHC) rupture. On the other hand, MMAB catalyzes Rh-carbon bond formation, converting rhodi(I)balamin in the presence of ATP to AdoRhbl. We report the first crystal structure of a rhodibalamin (AdoRhbl) bound to a B<sub>12</sub> protein, i.e., MMAB, in the presence of triphosphate, which shows a weakened but intact Rh-carbon bond. The structure provides insights into how MMAB cleaves the corresponding Co-carbon bond in a sacrificial homolytic reaction that purportedly functions as a cofactor sequestration strategy.

Rhodibalamins, the rhodium analogs of cobalamins, have been described as antimetabolites due to their ability to inhibit bacterial growth. In this study, we have examined the reactivity of adenosylrhodibalamin (AdoRhbl) with two key human chaperones, MMACHC (also known as CblC) and adenosyltransferase (MMAB, also known as ATR), and with the human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MMUT. We demonstrate that while AdoRhbl binds tightly to all four proteins, the Rh-carbon bond is resistant to homolytic (on MMAB and MMUT) as well as heterolytic (on MMACHC) rupture. On the other hand, MMAB catalyzes Rh-carbon bond formation, converting rhodi(I)balamin in the presence of ATP to AdoRhbl. We report the first crystal structure of a rhodibalamin (AdoRhbl) bound to a B<sub>12</sub> protein, i.e., MMAB, in the presence of triphosphate, which shows a weakened but intact Rh-carbon bond.

Flow cytometry was performed to determine effects of LCD on apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dysfunction, and multi-caspase activity in CRC cells. Western blot analysis was used to monitor levels of proteins involved in cell cycle and apoptosis signaling pathways. LCD suppressed the growth and anchorageindependent colony formation of both HCT116 and HCT116-OxR cells. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that LCD induced cell cycle arrest and increased cells in sub-G1 phase. In parallel with the antiproliferative effect of LCD, LCD up-regulated levels of p21 and p27 while downregulating cyclin B1 and cdc2. In addition, phosphorylation levels of JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were increased by LCD. Inhibition of these kinases somehow prevented the antiproliferative effect of LCD.

Flow cytometry was performed to determine effects of LCD on apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dysfunction, and multi-caspase activity in CRC cells. Western blot analysis was used to monitor levels of proteins involved in cell cycle and apoptosis signaling pathways.

In parallel with the antiproliferative effect of LCD, LCD up-regulated levels of p21 and p27 while downregulating cyclin B1 and cdc2. In addition, phosphorylation levels of JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were increased by LCD. Inhibition of these kinases somehow prevented the antiproliferative effect of LCD.

The microRNA miR-1205 acts as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, but its roles in breast cancer and metastasis remain unclear. To elucidate its function in breast cancer progression, we analyzed miR-1205 expression in human tumor samples and carried out a series of functional studies in in vitro and in vivo. miR-1205 was expressed more highly in metastatic breast tumor samples than in non-metastatic samples and was associated with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and poor prognosis. Moreover, miR-1205 promoted breast cancer cell invasiveness in vitro and metastasis in mice by directly targeting CDK3 and reducing CDK3 protein levels. We also showed that CDK3 interacts with Snail protein, inducing Snail degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and potentially affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, analysis of clinical tissue samples indicated that CDK3 and miR-1205 levels were inversely correlated in lymph node metastasis-positive primary tumors. This study demonstrated the pro-metastatic role of miR-1205 in breast cancer, mediated via a novel miR-1205/CDK3/Snail axis. Moreover, we identified miR-1205 and CDK3 as potential markers of invasion and progression in breast cancer.",

Natural changes in lighting conditions, as well as artificial disruptions like jet lag or shift work, can advance or delay the clock phase to align physiology with the environment. Within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, circadian timekeeping and resetting rely on both membrane depolarization and intracellular second-messenger signaling. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) facilitate calcium influx in both processes, activating intracellular signaling pathways that trigger Period (Per) gene expression. However, the precise mechanism by which these processes are concertedly gated remains unknown. Our study in mice demonstrates that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is modulated by light and regulates phase shifts of the circadian clock. We observed that knocking down Cdk5 in the SCN of mice affects phase delays but not phase advances. This is linked to uncontrolled calcium influx into SCN neurons and an unregulated protein kinase A (PKA)-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. Consequently, genes such as Per1 are not induced by light in the SCN of Cdk5 knock-down mice. Our experiments identified Cdk5 as a crucial light-modulated kinase that influences rapid clock phase adaptation. This finding elucidates how light responsiveness and clock phase coordination adapt activity onset to seasonal changes, jet lag, and shift work.",

This study focused on optimizing F059-1017, a previously identified CDK8 inhibitor, to enhance its potency. Through integrated structure-based modifications, a series of compounds was synthesized, and their inhibitory effects on CDK8 were tested. Results indicated that substituting with cyclopentanone significantly improved the inhibitory activity, and compound 4j demonstrated the best potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 16 nM). Notably, compared to F059-1017, its potency increased 35-fold, and kinase profiling revealed that the compound was selective for CDK8. Compound 4j inhibited the TGF-β1-induced EMT, cell migration, and morphological changes in A549 cells at a concentration of 0.1 μM and inhibited ECM and EMT protein expressions. In addition, the compound blocked TGF-β1-induced transcriptional changes and inhibited Smad3 and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation.

CircFUNDC1 is derived from the gene encoding the FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1) protein, which is essential for mitophagy and cell survival. Functional analyses reveal that circFUNDC1 plays a crucial role in maintaining extracellular matrix homeostasis by enhancing the expression of anabolic factors in NPCs. Additionally, we identified the transcriptional regulator cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as a novel binding partner for circFUNDC1. Binding with circFUNDC1 recruits CDK9 via complementary nucleotides to the FUNDC1 promoter to stimulate the production of full-length FUNDC1 mRNAs and proteins, forming a positive feedback loop. Overexpression of circFUNDC1 protects NPCs from oxidative stress by promoting mitophagy, reducing reactive oxygen species levels, and inhibiting cellular senescence. Moreover, circFUNDC1 overexpression delays the onset of IVDD in an ex-vivo culture model.

Traditionally, the pretreatment of whole blood involves the use of metal ions combined with organic solvents. However, this method requires multiple reagent additions, repeated opening, closing, and vortexing of vials, and it also leads to heavy metal pollution. Given the typically large sample volumes, optimizing this process is crucial for increasing throughput, reducing the workload of clinical staff, and lowering costs. We discovered that treating whole blood with a 60 to 75% acetonitrile (ACN) solution effectively releases tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine A while simultaneously precipitating protein. This allowed us to significantly simplify the pretreatment process to just adding 65% ACN solution containing internal standards, manually shaking for 20 s, and centrifuging for 2 min. The resulted supernatant can then be directly analyzed by mass spectrometry. Method validation demonstrated that the new approach can accurately quantify tacrolimus in the range of 0.64 to 37.5 ng/ml, cyclosporine A at 12 to 976 ng/ml, and sirolimus at 0.99 to 43.4 ng/ml. A comparison of paired samples showed the new method to be perfectly consistent with the classical method, with 293 out of 300 results deviating by no more than ± 20%. This study has greatly simplified the workflow, increased throughput, and resolved environmental concerns for therapeutic drug monitoring of immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine A, in whole blood samples. The proposed method is a viable replacement for existing protocols and deserves to be adopted in all clinical laboratories with relevant practical needs globally.",

            "source": "The mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome P450 11B2 (aldosterone synthase) catalyzes the 3 terminal transformations in the biosynthesis of aldosterone from 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC): 11β-hydroxylation to corticosterone, 18-hydroxylation, and 18-oxidation. Prior studies have shown that P450 11B2 produces more aldosterone from DOC than from the intermediate corticosterone and that the reaction sequence is processive, with intermediates remaining bound to the active site between oxygenation reactions. In contrast, P450 11B1 (11β-hydroxylase), which catalyzes the terminal step in cortisol biosynthesis, shares a 93% amino acid sequence identity with P450 11B2, converts DOC to corticosterone, but cannot synthesize aldosterone from DOC. The biochemical and biophysical properties of P450 11B2, which enable its unique 18-oxygenation activity and processivity, yet are not also represented in P450 11B1, remain unknown. To understand the mechanism of aldosterone biosynthesis, we introduced point mutations at residue 320, which partially exchange the activities of P450 11B1 and P450 11B2 (V320A and A320V, respectively). We then investigated NADPH coupling efficiencies, binding kinetics and affinities, and product formation of purified P450 11B1 and P450 11B2, wild-type, and residue 320 mutations in phospholipid vesicles and nanodiscs. Coupling efficiencies for the 18-hydroxylase reaction with corticosterone as the substrate failed to correlate with aldosterone synthesis, ruling out uncoupling as a relevant mechanism. Conversely, corticosterone dissociation rates correlated inversely with aldosterone production. We conclude that intermediate dissociation kinetics, not coupling efficiency, enable P450 11B2 to synthesize aldosterone via a processive mechanism. Our kinetic data also suggest that the binding of DOC to P450 11B enzymes occurs in at least two distinct steps, favoring an induced-fit mechanism.",

We then investigated NADPH coupling efficiencies, binding kinetics and affinities, and product formation of purified P450 11B1 and P450 11B2, wild-type, and residue 320 mutations in phospholipid vesicles and nanodiscs. Coupling efficiencies for the 18-hydroxylase reaction with corticosterone as the substrate failed to correlate with aldosterone synthesis, ruling out uncoupling as a relevant mechanism. Conversely, corticosterone dissociation rates correlated inversely with aldosterone production. We conclude that intermediate dissociation kinetics, not coupling efficiency, enable P450 11B2 to synthesize aldosterone via a processive mechanism. Our kinetic data also suggest that the binding of DOC to P450 11B enzymes occurs in at least two distinct steps, favoring an induced-fit mechanism.",

In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory to calculate the metabolic mechanism of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), an important PAH derivative. The results showed that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can metabolize 1-NP, with CYP 2A13 and CYP 2E1 being important enzyme isoforms, because they had lower binding affinities (-16.48 and -13.90 kcal/mol) to 1-NP than other CYPs (-2.38 to -7.89 kcal/mol). Additionally, these CYPs can metabolize 1-NP through epoxidation and hydroxylation pathways.

In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory to calculate the metabolic mechanism of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), an important PAH derivative. The results showed that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can metabolize 1-NP, with CYP 2A13 and CYP 2E1 being important enzyme isoforms, because they had lower binding affinities (-16.48 and -13.90 kcal/mol) to 1-NP than other CYPs (-2.38 to -7.89 kcal/mol). Additionally, these CYPs can metabolize 1-NP through epoxidation and hydroxylation pathways. Compared to hydroxylation, epoxidation had a lower energy barrier of 9.42 kcal/mol, and 4,5-epoxide-1-nitropyrene and 9,10-epoxide-1-nitropyrene were identified as the major epoxidation products through electrophilic addition. In addition, 6-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene and 8-hydroxy-1-nitropyrene were the major hydroxylated metabolites. Health risks revealed that electrophilicity of epoxides increased the risk of binding to DNA, and both 1-NP and its four important metabolites cause adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system and lung. In summary, this study revealed the metabolic mechanism of 1-NP by human CYPs and formation of toxic metabolites, and more attention should be paid to the nitro-derivatives of PAHs in the future.",

Overall, the network comprises 23 compounds and was developed based on 30 DGI, 45 DDI, and seven DDGI studies, covering 32 unique drug combinations. Good predictive performance was demonstrated for all interaction types, as reflected in mean geometric mean fold errors of 1.40, 1.38, and 1.56 for the DD(G)I area under the curve ratios as well as 1.29, 1.43, and 1.60 for DD(G)I maximum plasma concentration ratios. Finally, the presented network was utilized to calculate dose adaptations for CYP2D6 substrates atomoxetine (sensitive) and metoprolol (moderate sensitive) for clinically untested DDGI scenarios, showcasing a potential clinical application of DDGI model networks in the field of model-informed precision dosing.",

The impact of cornuside on CYP enzyme activity in human liver microsomes (HLMs) was examined in the presence of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µM of cornuside. In order to estimate the inhibition properties, Lineweaver-Burk plots were plotted and kinetic parameters were obtained. Furthermore, the time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by cornuside was also assessed. The activity of CYP3A4, 2C19, and 2E1 was suppressed by cornuside, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of 13.80, 19.44, and 24.55 µM, respectively.

In vitro studies revealed that cornuside inhibited CYP3A4, 2C19, and 2E1.

The location of the transgene provides valuable information for assessing potential effects of the transgenesis on the host and for designing genotyping protocols that can amplify across the integration site, but it is challenging to identify. Here, we report the successful utility of optical genome mapping technology to identify the transgene insertion site in a CYP2A13/2B6/2F1-transgenic mouse model, which produces three human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes (CYP2A13, CYP2B6, and CYP2F1) that are encoded by neighboring genes on human chromosome 19. These enzymes metabolize many drugs, respiratory toxicants, and chemical carcinogens. Initial efforts to identify candidate insertion sites by whole genome sequencing was unsuccessful, apparently because the transgene is located in a region of the mouse genome that contains highly repetitive sequences. Subsequent utility of the optical genome mapping approach, which compares genome-wide marker distribution between the transgenic mouse genome and a reference mouse (GRCm38) or human (GRCh38) genome, localized the insertion site to mouse chromosome 14, between two marker positions at 4451324 base pair and 4485032 base pair. A transgene-mouse genome junction sequence was further identified through long-polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing at GRCm38 Chr.14:4484726. The transgene insertion (∼2.4 megabase pair) contained 5-7 copies of the human transgenes, which replaced a 26.9-33.4 kilobase pair mouse genomic region, including exons 1-4 of Gm3182, a predicted and highly redundant gene. Finally, the sequencing results enabled the design of a new genotyping protocol that can distinguish between hemizygous and homozygous CYP2A13/2B6/2F1-transgenic mice.

Once in the body, metabolism serves as a powerful mediator of PAH toxicity by bioactivating and detoxifying PAH metabolites. Since enzyme expression and activity vary considerably throughout human development, we evaluated infant metabolism of PAHs as a potential contributing factor to PAH susceptibility. We measured and compared rates of phenanthrene and retene (two primary PAH constituents of woodsmoke) metabolism in human hepatic microsomes from individuals ≤21 months of age to a pooled sample (n = 200) consisting primarily of adults. We used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to characterize cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) in the same hepatic microsome samples. Once incubated in microsomes, phenanthrene demonstrated rapid depletion. Best-fit models for phenanthrene metabolism demonstrated either 1 or 2 phases, depending on the sample, indicating that multiple enzymes could metabolize phenanthrene. We observed no statistically significant differences in phenanthrene metabolism as a function of age, although samples from the youngest individuals had the slowest phenanthrene metabolism rates. We observed slower rates of retene metabolism compared with phenanthrene also in multiple phases. Rates of retene metabolism increased in an age-dependent manner until adult (pooled) metabolism rates were achieved at ∼12 months. ABPP identified 28 unique CYPs among all samples, and we observed lower amounts of active CYPs in individuals ≤21 months of age compared to the pooled sample. Phenanthrene metabolism correlated to CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2C8, 4A22, 3A4, and 3A43 and retene metabolism correlated to CYPs 1A1, 1A2, and 2C8 measured by ABPP and vendor-supplied substrate marker activities.

Here we show a human CAR agonist/PXR antagonist, MI-883, which effectively regulates genes related to xenobiotic metabolism and cholesterol/bile acid homeostasis by leveraging CAR and PXR interactions in gene regulation. Through comprehensive analyses utilizing lipidomics, bile acid metabolomics, and transcriptomics in humanized PXR-CAR-CYP3A4/3A7 mice fed high-fat and high-cholesterol diets, we demonstrate that MI-883 significantly reduces plasma cholesterol levels and enhances fecal bile acid excretion. This work paves the way for the development of ligands targeting multiple xenobiotic nuclear receptors. Such ligands hold the potential for precise modulation of liver metabolism, offering new therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders.",
