We recently reported that the oral administration of a fungal protein Lingzhi-8 (LZ-8) prevented autoimmune colitis in mice via maintaining barrier integrity. Here, we examined the functional effect of LZ-8 on gut CD103+ DCs and on autoimmune psoriasis in a mouse model. After orally administered LZ-8 to mice, the numbers of CD103+ DCs and their retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) activities were increased in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), which were associated with increased regulatory T cell (Treg) in the spleen and LNs. This suggests that LZ-8 induces oral tolerance by enhancing the RALDH2 activity of CD103+ DCs. In addition, the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis was attenuated in mice after LZ-8 pretreatment. In the mechanistic study, we generated gut CD103+ DC-like cells from bone marrow (BM) of wild-type mouse and cultured them in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) in vitro. We found that LZ-8 directly enhanced the RALDH2 activity of these RA-primed CD103+ DCs, which was dependent on Dectin-1 and Syk signaling pathways but not TLR4. Together, our study demonstrated that LZ-8 facilitated gut tolerogenic CD103+ DC-mediated immunosuppression by enhancing RALDH2 activity, increasing Treg cell population, and signaling through Dectin-1 and Syk.

We found that LZ-8 directly enhanced the RALDH2 activity of these RA-primed CD103+ DCs, which was dependent on Dectin-1 and Syk signaling pathways but not TLR4. Together, our study demonstrated that LZ-8 facilitated gut tolerogenic CD103+ DC-mediated immunosuppression by enhancing RALDH2 activity, increasing Treg cell population, and signaling through Dectin-1 and Syk. Our findings provide a novel strategy for treating psoriasis and potentially other autoimmune diseases.",

Here, we examined the functional effect of LZ-8 on gut CD103+ DCs and on autoimmune psoriasis in a mouse model. After orally administered LZ-8 to mice, the numbers of CD103+ DCs and their retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) activities were increased in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), which were associated with increased regulatory T cell (Treg) in the spleen and LNs.

Among these, the metabolic engineering of cell lines has been one of the most promising approaches. Based on previous work and a proteomic analysis of HEK293 cells producing Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Gag VLPs under transient transfection, four proteins susceptible of enhancing VLP production were identified: ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATR), DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), and retinal rod rhodopsin-sensitive cGMP 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase subunit delta (PDEδ). The knockdown of ATM, ATR, and PDEδ in HEK293 cells increased HIV-1 VLP titers in the supernatant by 3.4-, 2.1-, and 2.2-fold, respectively. Also, possible metabolic synergies between plasmids were investigated by statistical design of experiments (DoE), enabling us to identify the optimal production strategy, that was further demonstrated at lab-scale stirred tank bioreactor operated in perfusion, significantly increasing both VLPs specific and volumetric productivities to 8.3 × 103 VLPs/cellxday and 7.5 × 1012 VLPs/Lxday, respectively.

The present results demonstrated that RRM1 has a critical role in the biological gene program that regulates the extracellular matrix, which promotes the aggressive malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer.",

The mRNA levels of ATR, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), WEE1, ribonucleotide reductase (RR) catalytic subunit M1 (RRM1) and RRM2 were measured by qRT-PCR. Cellular γ-(H2A histone family member X) H2AX levels were measured by Western blot. Analyses were conducted using ELISA to assess 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) levels. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ELISA death assays were used to assess apoptosis.The SW-480 and HT-29 cells have low proliferation rate when treated with VE-822 and AZD1775. The IC50 value for VE-822 was 1.3 μM and 1.6 μM in SW480 and HT-29, respectively. Also, this value for AZD1775 in SW480 was 140 nM and in HT-29 was 185 nM. The expression levels of ATR, CHK1, WEE1, RRM1, and RRM2 were significantly downregulated in both cell lines treated with combination of VE-822 and AZD1775 (P<0.05). DNA damage markers, including γ-H2AX and 8-oxo-dG were upregulated in these cells. Simultaneous treatment with VE-822 and AZD177 increased apoptosis capacity of both cell lines.The inhibition of WEE1 via AZD1775 potentiated the anticancer effects of ATR inhibitor, VE-822, in combating colorectal cancer via targeting DNA damage. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39805293/",

While plants provide a natural method of removing FA pollution, their ability to absorb and degrade FA is limited. To improve the ability of plants to degrade FA, we introduced the E. coli FrmA gene into Arabidopsis thaliana alone (FrmAOE lines) or with FrmB (FrmA/BOE lines). The transgenic seedlings had approximately 30 % longer primary roots and a 20 % higher fresh weight than the control plants. The transgenic plants started flowering four days earlier and had about 30 % more kilo-seed weight than the wild type. FrmA/BOE and FrmAOE accumulated 40 % more reactive oxidative species (ROS) in mesophyll protoplasts and leaf tissue than wild-type plants under normal conditions. In the presence of FA, they produced 92 % and 26 % more glutathione (GSH) and 6 % and 4 % more ascorbate (AsA), respectively, compared to wild-type plants and thus scavenged FA-induced ROS more effectively.

The effects of lipid emulsion on labetalol-induced changes in cell viability, expression of Bax/Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9, and phosphorylation of GSK-3β, Akt, and PI3K were examined. Lipid emulsion inhibited labetalol-induced decrease in cell viability, whereas LY294002, MK2206, and SB216763, the inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), respectively, partially attenuated this restoration of cell viability. Lipid emulsion reversed the increase in expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and Bax/Bcl-2 and decrease in the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, Akt, and PI3K by labetalol. Lipid emulsion and cyclosporin, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) inhibitor, reduced the labetalol-induced increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells and promoted late-stage apoptosis. Overall, lipid emulsion inhibited apoptotic cell death caused by labetalol toxicity via the inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic pathway and MPTP in rat cardiomyoblasts, which appears to involve PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β signaling pathways.",

The total ethanolic extract and its fractions, obtained via Diaion HP-20 column chromatography, were evaluated for monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibition in vitro. The 50% methanol fraction (PG50) demonstrated the highest MAO-B inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> 5.26 ± 0.12 µg/ml) compared to the reference drug selegiline (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.021 ± 0.003 µg/ml). In a rotenone-induced PD rat model, PG50 (100 mg/kg, p.o.) alleviated motor deficits (assessed via the wire hanging test), and restored norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin levels. PG50 and L-dopa reduced α-synuclein levels by 367.60% and 377.48%, respectively. Oxidative balance was restored with increased glutathione (23.12%) and decreased malondialdehyde (164.19%) in brain tissues. PG50 significantly reduced serum TNF-α (572.79%) and IL-6 (70.84%) levels, and improved succinate dehydrogenase (14.47%) and lactate dehydrogenase (7.74%) activities in brain tissues. Histopathological alterations in the SN were also ceased. UPLC-MS/MS analysis identified 61 metabolites, including 32 flavonoids, 13 phenolic acids, 7 coumarins, 5 phenolic glycosides, and 4 dicarboxylic acids, with in silico docking showing strong MAO-B binding by methoxylated flavonoids like methoxyluteolin dimethyl ether (docking score: - 8.0625 kcal/mol), surpassing that of safinamide (- 8.2615 kcal/mol).

PG50 and L-dopa reduced α-synuclein levels by 367.60% and 377.48%, respectively. Oxidative balance was restored with increased glutathione (23.12%) and decreased malondialdehyde (164.19%) in brain tissues. PG50 significantly reduced serum TNF-α (572.79%) and IL-6 (70.84%) levels, and improved succinate dehydrogenase (14.47%) and lactate dehydrogenase (7.74%) activities in brain tissues. Histopathological alterations in the SN were also ceased. UPLC-MS/MS analysis identified 61 metabolites, including 32 flavonoids, 13 phenolic acids, 7 coumarins, 5 phenolic glycosides, and 4 dicarboxylic acids, with in silico docking showing strong MAO-B binding by methoxylated flavonoids like methoxyluteolin dimethyl ether (docking score: - 8.0625 kcal/mol), surpassing that of safinamide (- 8.2615 kcal/mol). These findings suggest that P. graveolens holds promise as a neuroprotective agent against rotenone-induced PD.",

The mild group (n = 3) had two cases of splice errors and one missense mutation. All patients with CSR defect had elevated IgM serum levels, whereas all switched immunoglobulins were reduced in them. Expression of ATM and p-ATM proteins was significantly lower (p = 0.01) in all patients compared to healthy controls, both pre-and post- and post-radiation. Additionally, low ATM and p-ATM protein expression levels were linked with the clinical severity of patients but were not correlated with CSR defects.",

To identify cancer-driver genes from the regions of SCNA, we have devised a scoring system that integrates information from different genetic alterations. Applying this scoring system to the TCGA-HGSOC dataset (n = 316) we have identified several well-known and novel putative cancer genes in HGSOC. We functionally validated the roles of two previously unknown genes, RNF144B and PPP2R2A. RNF144B, an E3 ubiquitin-ligase is amplified and overexpressed in 16% of HGSOC (TCGA). Overexpression of RNF144B in ovarian cancer cells increased cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. RNF144B was significantly overexpressed in 50% of primary tumors from patients with HGSOC compared to the ovary. Further, it had significantly reduced expression in tumors after chemotherapy. PPP2R2A, the regulatory subunit of PP2A is deleted and downregulated in 38% of HGSOCs (TCGA). Overexpression of PPP2R2A inhibited cell proliferation, colony-formation, migration, and invasion in ovarian cancer cells.

To identify cancer-driver genes from the regions of SCNA, we have devised a scoring system that integrates information from different genetic alterations. Applying this scoring system to the TCGA-HGSOC dataset (n = 316) we have identified several well-known and novel putative cancer genes in HGSOC. We functionally validated the roles of two previously unknown genes, RNF144B and PPP2R2A. RNF144B, an E3 ubiquitin-ligase is amplified and overexpressed in 16% of HGSOC (TCGA). Overexpression of RNF144B in ovarian cancer cells increased cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. RNF144B was significantly overexpressed in 50% of primary tumors from patients with HGSOC compared to the ovary. Further, it had significantly reduced expression in tumors after chemotherapy. PPP2R2A, the regulatory subunit of PP2A is deleted and downregulated in 38% of HGSOCs (TCGA). Overexpression of PPP2R2A inhibited cell proliferation, colony-formation, migration, and invasion in ovarian cancer cells. In OVCAR-5, which expresses low levels of PPP2R2A, Niraparib inhibited cell proliferation. PPP2R2A was not expressed in 72% of HGSOCs. This report demonstrates this approach to identifying genes from the TCGA data. Further experiments are required to conclusively prove the role of these genes in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.",

We employed shotgun liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomic and metabonomic profiling approaches on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal (HPC) tissue from Df(16)A+/- mice, a model of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Proteomic results were compared with previous transcriptomic profiling studies of the same brain regions. The aim was to investigate how the combined effect of the 22q11.2 deletion and the corresponding miRNA dysregulation affects the cell biology at the systems level. The proteomic brain profiling analysis revealed PFC and HPC changes in various molecular pathways associated with chromatin remodelling and RNA transcription, indicative of an epigenetic component of the 22q11.2DS. Further, alterations in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial function and lipid biosynthesis were identified. Metabonomic profiling substantiated the proteomic findings by identifying changes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)-related pathways, such as changes in ceramide phosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin, carnitines, tyrosine derivates and panthothenic acid. The proteomic findings were confirmed using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, validating decreased levels of several proteins encoded on 22q11.2, increased levels of the computationally predicted putative miR-185 targets UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 110 kDa subunit (OGT1) and kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A and alterations in the non-miR-185 targets serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit gamma isoform, neurofilament light chain and vesicular glutamate transporter 1. Furthermore, alterations in the proteins associated with mammalian target of rapamycin signalling were detected in the PFC and with glutamatergic signalling in the hippocampus. Based on the proteomic and metabonomic findings, we were able to develop a schematic model summarizing the most prominent molecular network findings in the Df(16)A+/- mouse. Interestingly, the implicated pathways can be linked to one of the most consistent and strongest proteomic candidates, (OGT1), which is a predicted miR-185 target. Our results provide novel insights into system-biological mechanisms associated with the 22q11DS, which may be linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk to develop schizophrenia. Further investigation of these pathways could help to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

Metabonomic profiling substantiated the proteomic findings by identifying changes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)-related pathways, such as changes in ceramide phosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin, carnitines, tyrosine derivates and panthothenic acid. The proteomic findings were confirmed using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, validating decreased levels of several proteins encoded on 22q11.2, increased levels of the computationally predicted putative miR-185 targets UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 110 kDa subunit (OGT1) and kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A and alterations in the non-miR-185 targets serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit gamma isoform, neurofilament light chain and vesicular glutamate transporter 1. Furthermore, alterations in the proteins associated with mammalian target of rapamycin signalling were detected in the PFC and with glutamatergic signalling in the hippocampus. Based on the proteomic and metabonomic findings, we were able to develop a schematic model summarizing the most prominent molecular network findings in the Df(16)A+/- mouse. Interestingly, the implicated pathways can be linked to one of the most consistent and strongest proteomic candidates, (OGT1), which is a predicted miR-185 target. Our results provide novel insights into system-biological mechanisms associated with the 22q11DS, which may be linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk to develop schizophrenia. Further investigation of these pathways could help to identify novel drug targets for the treatment of schizophrenia.",

            "source": "9430683: A novel serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PPase) designated PP7 was identified from cDNA produced from human retina RNA. PP7 has a molecular mass of approximately 75 kDa, and the deduced amino acid sequence of PP7 contains a phosphatase catalytic core domain that possesses all of the invariant motifs of the PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP4, PP5, and PP6 gene family. However, PP7 has unique N- and C-terminal regions and shares < 35% identity with the other known PPases. The unique C-terminal region of PP7 contains multiple Ca2+ binding sites (i.e. EF-hand motifs). This region of PP7 is similar to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C gene product (rdgC), and PP7 and rdgC share 42.1% identity. Unlike the other known PPases, the expression of PP7 is not ubiquitous; PP7 was only detected in retina and retinal-derived Y-79 retinoblastoma cells. Expression of recombinant human PP7 in baculovirus-infected SF21 insect cells produces an active soluble enzyme that is capable of utilizing phosphohistone and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrates. The activity of recombinant PP7 is dependent on Mg2+ and is activated by calcium (IC50 approximately equal to 250 microM). PP7 is not affected by calmodulin and is insensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, calyculin A, and cantharidin.",

PP7 is not affected by calmodulin and is insensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, calyculin A, and cantharidin.",

Group IVA was maintained with propofol and remifentanil, while Group CIA used sevoflurane, propofol, and remifentanil, with sevoflurane stopped after carotid exposure. Hemodynamics were controlled at various stages: ±10% before clamping, + 20% during clamping (metaraminol), and 0 to -10% after exposure. HR, MAP, and rSO₂ were recorded at T0 (pre-induction), T1 (pre-clamping), T2 (post-clamping), T3 (5 min post-clamping), T4 (10 min post-clamping), T5 (15 min post-clamping), and T6 (15 min post-reperfusion). Blood samples were taken at T1, T6, and T7 (24 h post-surgery) for blood gas and S100-β analysis.",

However, the sudden restoration of normal blood flow leads to ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI), which results in cardiomyoblast death, irreversible tissue degeneration, and heart failure. The molecular mechanism of IRI is not fully understood, and there are no effective cardioprotective strategies to prevent it. In this study, we show that activation of sialidase-3, a glycohydrolytic enzyme that cleaves sialic acid residues from glycoconjugates, is cardioprotective by triggering RISK pro-survival signaling pathways. We found that overexpression of Neu3 significantly increased cardiomyoblast resistance to IRI through activation of HIF-1α and Akt/Erk signaling pathways. This raises the possibility of using Sialidase-3 activation as a cardioprotective reperfusion strategy after myocardial infarction.",

Our data show that discrimination between substrates and identification of the cleavage site by SPC is compromised when Spc2 is absent or mutated.
