One of the most studied AMPs, the human cathelicidin derived AMP LL-37 is notable for its antimicrobial activity even though its mechanism of action is not fully understood yet. This work investigates the interaction of LL-37 with 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (POPG) vesicles, which were employed as a bacterial membrane model given the common presence of this phospholipid in the bacterial membrane. Experimental techniques including small angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering were used to characterize the interactions among LL-37 and POPG. Molecular dynamics simulations complement the experimental studies with molecular-level insights into the process. LL-37 was discovered to actively and critically interact with the POPG vesicles, modifying the membrane curvature that eventually leads to structural transformations from vesicles to mixed micelles. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions among LL-37 and bacteria mimetic vesicles and can guide the further development of AMP based antimicrobial materials and therapies. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33839361/",

The rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels can be due to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), which is a product of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis by phospholipases C (PLCs), that leads to Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum by InsP3 receptors (InsP3R). Ca2+ signaling patterns can vary in different regions of the cell and increases in nuclear Ca2+ levels have specific biological effects that differ from those of Ca2+ increase in the cytoplasm. There are PLCs in the cytoplasm and nucleus, but little is known about the functions of nuclear PLCs. This work aimed to characterize phenotypically the human PLCδ4 (hPLCδ4) in mesenchymal stem cells. This nuclear isoform of PLC is present in different cell types and has a possible role in proliferative processes. In this work, hPLCδ4 was found to be mainly nuclear in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASC). PLCδ4 knockdown demonstrated that it is essential for hASC proliferation, without inducing cell death. An increase of cells in G1, and a reduction of cells on interphase and G2/M in knockdown cells were seen. Furthermore, PLCδ4 knockdown increased the percentage of senescent cells, p16INK4A+ and p21Cip1 mRNAs expression, which could explain the impaired cell proliferation. The results show that hPLCδ4 is in involved in cellular proliferation and senescence in hASC.",

This review aims to bridge the gap between preclinical findings and potential clinical applications, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Searches included MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on preclinical in vivo studies involving opioids and psychedelics in animals, excluding pain studies and those lacking control groups. Forty studies met criteria, covering both classic and non-classic psychedelics. Most studies showed that 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), ibogaine, noribogaine, and ketamine could reduce opioid self-administration, alleviate withdrawal symptoms, and change conditioned place preference. However, seven studies (two on 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), three on ibogaine, one on 18-MC, and one on ketamine) showed no improvement over controls. A methodological quality assessment rated most of the studies as having unclear quality. Interestingly, most preclinical studies are limited to iboga derivatives, which were effective, but these agents may have higher cardiovascular risk than other psychedelics under-explored to date. This review strengthens support for translational studies testing psychedelics as potential innovative targets for OUD.

This review summarizes the current knowledge and recent advances in understanding the contribution of the PDE4 subfamily to cardiovascular function and underscores the intricate challenges associated with targeting PDE4 enzymes as a therapeutic strategy for the management of cardiovascular diseases.",

Recent research has highlighted the significance of palmitic acid (PA) in triggering pro-inflammatory pathways contributing to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, Genomic-scale metabolic models and control theory have revealed that metabolic switches (MSs) are metabolic pathway regulators by potentially exacerbating neurotoxicity, thereby offering promising therapeutic targets. Herein, we characterized these enzymatic MSs in silico as potential therapeutic targets, employing protein-protein and drug-protein interaction networks alongside structural characterization techniques. Our findings indicate that five MSs (P00558, P04406, Q08426, P09110, and O76062) were functionally linked to nervous system drug targets and may be indirectly regulated by specific neurological drugs, some of which exhibit polypharmacological potential (e.g., Trifluperidol, Trifluoperazine, Disulfiram, and Haloperidol).

In these terms, the sulfation pattern of HS, created by an orchestrated activity of enzymes balancing a site-specific sulfation, is of key importance. These enzymes are often deregulated by epigenetic processes in cancer, e.g., being silenced by DNA hypermethylation. Here, we address this issue in human breast cancer cell lines aiming to target epigenetic processes to reactivate HS sulfation, shifting HS into an antithrombotic phenotype for which 3-O-sulfation is particularly important. Treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with nontoxic concentrations of 5-azacytidine (azacytidine) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (FdCyd) as DNMT inhibitors or vorinostat for targeting HDAC increased HS3-O-sulfation remarkably, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, by upregulating HS3-O-sulfotransferases, detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Flow cytometry and microscopic approaches confirm that upon inhibitor treatment, increased HS3-O-sulfation improves cell binding to antithrombin, leading to an antithrombotic activity. Nevertheless, only azacytidine- and vorinostat-treated cells display anticoagulative properties, represented by attenuated thrombin formation, a lower activation of human platelet aggregation, or ATP release. In contrast, FdCyd additionally upregulated tissue factor expression in both cell lines, overshadowing the anticoagulant effects of HS, leading to an overall prothrombotic phenotype. Our data provide evidence for the first time that targeting epigenetic processes in HS sulfation is a valuable means to foster anticoagulative cell properties for decreasing malignancy and metastatic potency.

The reasons why neutrophils of newborns are less responsive than those of adults are not clear. Because adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine (ADO) tightly regulate neutrophils, we studied whether the ATP and ADO levels in the blood of newborn mice could impair the function of their neutrophils. We observed significant changes in plasma ATP and ADO levels throughout the lifespan of mice. ADO levels in newborns were significantly higher than in older mice, while ATP levels were significantly lower. These changes were particularly striking in newborn and juvenile mice with ATP and ADO levels of about 80 and 600 nM in newborns versus 130 and 190 nM in juveniles, respectively. The ratios of the ATP versus ADO levels of newborns were (with 0.2) significantly lower than those of juveniles (1.4) and adults (0.5). These low ATP/ADO ratios correlated with significantly weakened neutrophil activation responses following in vitro stimulation with a formyl peptide receptor agonist and a markedly higher morbidity and mortality rate of newborns following bacterial infection. We found that enhanced AMP hydrolysis via CD73, a lack of ADO breakdown by adenosine deaminase, and reduced ADO uptake by nucleoside transporters are responsible for the low ATP/ADO ratios in blood of newborn mice. We conclude that the extracellular ADO accumulation in newborn mice impairs inflammatory responses and reduces the ability of neutrophils to mount effective antimicrobial defenses against bacterial infections.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the outcomes of placental inflammation, is characterized by loss of membrane potential, accumulation of oxygen radicals, mitochondrial protein folding defects, and disturbances in mitochondrial dynamics. Protein kinase R (PKR) is stimulated by double-stranded RNA and bacterial endotoxins in the presence of pathogens and is a critical immune response enzyme. PKR is also correlated with the cell death response during endoplasmic reticulum stress.",

            "source": "Diabetes mellitus remains a global health challenge, demanding innovative therapeutic solutions. Herein, we present the design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of a novel series of carbazole-thiadiazole hybrids targeting key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism. Among the synthesized compounds, 5l emerged as the most potent inhibitor of α-amylase, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.68 µM-far surpassing the efficacy of the standard drug acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub>: 5.19 µM). Similarly, 5r exhibited exceptional dual activity against both α-amylase and α-glucosidase, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.63 µM and 0.14 µM, respectively, highlighting its dual inhibitory potential. Biological assays demonstrated the compounds' low cytotoxicity on hepatic stellate (LX-2) cells, affirming their safety for therapeutic use. Molecular docking studies provided mechanistic insights into their binding interactions, revealing strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with key active site residues. Density functional theory (DFT) and electrostatic potential (ESP) analyses further elucidated their electronic properties, offering a deeper understanding of their structure-activity relationships. Pharmacokinetic profiling via the BOILED-Egg model confirmed these derivatives' excellent oral bioavailability and drug-likeness. Collectively, these findings establish carbazole-thiadiazole hybrids as promising candidates for next-generation antidiabetic therapies, warranting further investigation in preclinical and clinical settings.",

The combined use of drugs in the treatment of T2DM leads to serious side effects, including gastrointestinal problems, liver toxicity, hypoglycemia, and treatment costs. Hence, there has been a growing emphasis on drugs that demonstrate dual interactions. Several studies have suggested that dual-target agents for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) and alpha-glucosidase (α-glucosidase) could be a potent approach for treating patients with diabetes. We aim to develop new antidiabetic agents that target PPAR-γ and α-glucosidase enzymes using molecular modeling techniques. These compounds show dual interactions, are more effective, and have fewer side effects. The molecular docking method was employed to investigate the enzyme-ligand interaction mechanisms of 159 newly designed compounds with target enzymes. Additionally, we evaluated the ADME properties and pharmacokinetic suitability of these compounds based on Lipinski and Veber's rules. Compound 70, which exhibited favorable ADME properties, demonstrated more effective binding energy with both PPAR-γ and α-glucosidase enzymes (-12,16 kcal/mol, -10.07 kcal/mol) compared to the reference compounds of Acetohexamide (-9.31 kcal/mol, -7.48 kcal/mol) and Glibenclamide (-11.12 kcal/mol, -8.66 kcal/mol). Further, analyses of MM/PBSA binding free energy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for target enzymes with compound 70, which exhibited the most favorable binding affinities with both enzymes.

            "source": "38642318: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a serious public health problem both in our country and worldwide, being the most prevalent type of diabetes. The combined use of drugs in the treatment of T2DM leads to serious side effects, including gastrointestinal problems, liver toxicity, hypoglycemia, and treatment costs. Hence, there has been a growing emphasis on drugs that demonstrate dual interactions. Several studies have suggested that dual-target agents for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) and alpha-glucosidase (α-glucosidase) could be a potent approach for treating patients with diabetes. We aim to develop new antidiabetic agents that target PPAR-γ and α-glucosidase enzymes using molecular modeling techniques. These compounds show dual interactions, are more effective, and have fewer side effects. The molecular docking method was employed to investigate the enzyme-ligand interaction mechanisms of 159 newly designed compounds with target enzymes. Additionally, we evaluated the ADME properties and pharmacokinetic suitability of these compounds based on Lipinski and Veber's rules. Compound 70, which exhibited favorable ADME properties, demonstrated more effective binding energy with both PPAR-γ and α-glucosidase enzymes (-12,16 kcal/mol, -10.07 kcal/mol) compared to the reference compounds of Acetohexamide (-9.31 kcal/mol, -7.48 kcal/mol) and Glibenclamide (-11.12 kcal/mol, -8.66 kcal/mol). Further, analyses of MM/PBSA binding free energy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for target enzymes with compound 70, which exhibited the most favorable binding affinities with both enzymes. Based on this information, our study aims to contribute to the development of new dual-target antidiabetic agents with improved efficacy, reduced side effects, and enhanced reliability for diabetes treatment.",
