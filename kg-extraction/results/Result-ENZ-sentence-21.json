This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of icaritin on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms. 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) was employed as a probe drug for all the tested UGT isoforms using in vitro human liver microsomes (HLM). The inhibition potentials of UGT1A1 and 1A9 in HLM were further tested by employing 17β-estradiol (E2) and propofol (PRO) as probe substrates, respectively. The results showed that icaritin inhibits UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A7, 1A8, 1A10, 2B7, and 2B15. Furthermore, icaritin exhibited a mixed inhibition of UGT1A1, 1A3, and 1A9, and the inhibition kinetic parameters (K<sub>i</sub>) were calculated to be 3.538, 2.117, and 0.306 (μM), respectively.

However, the exact identity of the UGT isoform that contribute to the formation of this glucuronide remains uncertain. In this study, we harnessed a robust reaction phenotyping strategy to delineate the identities and its associated fraction metabolized (f<sub>m</sub>) of the UGTs involved in lamotrigine N2-glucuronidation. Foremost, human recombinant UGT mapping experiments revealed that the N2-glucuronide is catalyzed by multiple UGT isoforms. (i.e., UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, and 2B10). Thereafter, scaling the apparent intrinsic clearances obtained from the enzyme kinetic experiments with our in-house liver-derived relative expression factors (REF) and relative activity factors (RAF) revealed that, in addition to UGT1A4, UGT2B10 was involved in the N2-glucuronidation of lamotrigine. This was further confirmed via chemical inhibition in human liver microsomes with the UGT1A4-selective inhibitor hecogenin and the UGT2B10-selective inhibitor desloratadine. By integrating various orthogonal approaches (i.e., REF- and RAF-scaling, and chemical inhibition), we quantitatively determined that the f<sub>m</sub> for UGT1A4 and UGT2B10 ranged from 0.42 - 0.64 and 0.32 - 0.57, respectively. Finally, we also provided nascent evidence that the pharmacokinetic interaction between lamotrigine and valproic acid likely arose from the in vivo inhibition of its UGT2B10-mediated pathway.",

The UGT1A locus generates nine UGT1A mRNAs, 65 spliced transcripts, and 34 circular RNAs. In this study, our analysis of published UGT-RNA capture sequencing (CaptureSeq) datasets identified novel splice junctions that predict 24 variant UGT1A transcripts derived from ligation of exon 2 to unique sequences within the UGT1A first-exon region using cryptic donor splice sites. Of these variants, seven (1A1_n1, 1A3_n3, 1A4_n4, 1A5_n1, 1A8_n2, 1A9_n2, 1A10_n7) are predicted to encode UGT1A proteins with truncated aglycone-binding domains. We assessed their expression profiles and deregulation in cancer using four RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets of paired normal and cancerous drug-metabolizing tissues from large patient cohorts. Variants were generally coexpressed with their canonical counterparts with a higher relative abundance in tumor than in normal tissues. Variants showed tissue-specific expression with high interindividual variability but overall low abundance. However, 1A8_n2 showed high abundance in normal and cancerous colorectal tissues, with levels that approached or surpassed canonical 1A8 mRNA levels in many samples. We cloned 1A8_n2 and showed expression of the predicted protein (1A8_i3) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells. Glucuronidation assays with 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) showed that 1A8_i3 had no activity and was unable to inhibit the activity of 1A8_i1 protein. In summary, the activation of cryptic donor splice sites within the UGT1A first-exon region expands the UGT1A transcriptome and proteome. The 1A8_n2 cryptic donor splice site is highly active in colorectal tissues, representing an important cis-regulatory element that negatively regulates the function of the UGT1A8 gene through pre-mRNA splicing. SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT: The UGT1A locus generates nine canonical mRNAs, 65 alternately spliced transcripts, and 34 different circular RNAs. The present study reports a series of novel UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A variants resulting from use of cryptic donor splice sites in both normal and cancerous tissues, several of which are predicted to encode variant UGT1A proteins with truncated aglycone-binding domains. Of these, 1A8_n2 shows exceptionally high abundance in colorectal tissues, highlighting its potential role in the first-pass metabolism in gut through the glucuronidation pathway.",

We cloned 1A8_n2 and showed expression of the predicted protein (1A8_i3) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells. Glucuronidation assays with 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) showed that 1A8_i3 had no activity and was unable to inhibit the activity of 1A8_i1 protein. In summary, the activation of cryptic donor splice sites within the UGT1A first-exon region expands the UGT1A transcriptome and proteome. The 1A8_n2 cryptic donor splice site is highly active in colorectal tissues, representing an important cis-regulatory element that negatively regulates the function of the UGT1A8 gene through pre-mRNA splicing. SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT: The UGT1A locus generates nine canonical mRNAs, 65 alternately spliced transcripts, and 34 different circular RNAs. The present study reports a series of novel UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A variants resulting from use of cryptic donor splice sites in both normal and cancerous tissues, several of which are predicted to encode variant UGT1A proteins with truncated aglycone-binding domains. Of these, 1A8_n2 shows exceptionally high abundance in colorectal tissues, highlighting its potential role in the first-pass metabolism in gut through the glucuronidation pathway.",

The UGT1A locus generates nine UGT1A mRNAs, 65 spliced transcripts, and 34 circular RNAs. In this study, our analysis of published UGT-RNA capture sequencing (CaptureSeq) datasets identified novel splice junctions that predict 24 variant UGT1A transcripts derived from ligation of exon 2 to unique sequences within the UGT1A first-exon region using cryptic donor splice sites. Of these variants, seven (1A1_n1, 1A3_n3, 1A4_n4, 1A5_n1, 1A8_n2, 1A9_n2, 1A10_n7) are predicted to encode UGT1A proteins with truncated aglycone-binding domains. We assessed their expression profiles and deregulation in cancer using four RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets of paired normal and cancerous drug-metabolizing tissues from large patient cohorts. Variants were generally coexpressed with their canonical counterparts with a higher relative abundance in tumor than in normal tissues. Variants showed tissue-specific expression with high interindividual variability but overall low abundance. However, 1A8_n2 showed high abundance in normal and cancerous colorectal tissues, with levels that approached or surpassed canonical 1A8 mRNA levels in many samples.

Chemical inhibitors are a common factor decreasing UGT activities and furtherly inducing health problems. Although simultaneously encountering different inhibitors is readily to occur, no information is available for combined inhibition of UGT. This in vitro study investigates the combined inhibition of human UGT1A9 by endogenous and foodborne inhibitors (magnolol, di-bromophenols, UDP). J values (the ratio of inhibitory rate to the remaining activity) are analysed to determine the combined inhibition type.

Additionally, liver microsomal and cytosolic fractions from rat, mouse and pig were used. Following incubations of the biocolourants with the enzymes in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, UDP-glucuronic acid, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) or S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to enable CYP oxidation, glucuronidation, sulfonation or methylation, we observed several oxidation and conjugation metabolites for dermocybin but none for dermorubin.

In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of the RNAseq and clinical datasets of 9514 patients from 33 different TCGA (the Genome Cancer Atlas) cancers demonstrated cancer-specific UGT expression profiles with high interindividual variability among and within individual cancers. Notably, cancers derived from drug metabolizing tissues (liver, kidney, gut, pancreas) expressed the largest number of UGT genes (COAD, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC, PAAD); six UGT genes (1A6, 1A9, 1A10, 2A3, 2B7, UGT8) showed high expression in five or more different cancers. Kaplan-Meier plots and logrank tests revealed that six UGT genes were significantly associated with increased overall survival (OS) rates [UGT1A1 (LUSC), UGT1A6 (ACC), UGT1A7 (ACC), UGT2A3 (KIRC), UGT2B15 (BLCA, SKCM)] or decreased OS rates [UGT2B15 (LGG), UGT8 (UVM)] in specific cancers.

The purpose of this article was to assess the effects of selumetinib on the activities of twelve human UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) including UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, 2B4, 2B7, 2B15, and 2B17, and its potential for inducing clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The results demonstrated that selumetinib potently inhibited the activity of UGT2B7 through the mechanism of mixed inhibition with the inhibition constant value of 5.79 ± 0.65 μM. Furthermore, the plasma concentration of UGT2B7 substrate as the co-administered drug was predicted to be increased by at least 84 % when patients took selumetinib 75 mg twice daily, suggesting a high potential to induce clinical DDIs. Selumetinib exhibited weak inhibitory effects on other human UGTs and was unlikely to trigger off UGTs-mediated DDIs except for UGT2B7. Therefore, the combination of selumetinib with the substrate drug of UGT2B7 requires additional attention to avoid adverse events in clinical treatment.",

While there is consensus that UGT1A4 plays a predominant role in the formation of the N2-glucuronide, there is compelling evidence in the literature to suggest that the metabolism of lamotrigine is catalyzed by another UGT isoform. However, the exact identity of the UGT isoform that contribute to the formation of this glucuronide remains uncertain. In this study, we harnessed a robust reaction phenotyping strategy to delineate the identities and its associated fraction metabolized (f<sub>m</sub>) of the UGTs involved in lamotrigine N2-glucuronidation. Foremost, human recombinant UGT mapping experiments revealed that the N2-glucuronide is catalyzed by multiple UGT isoforms. (i.e., UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, and 2B10). Thereafter, scaling the apparent intrinsic clearances obtained from the enzyme kinetic experiments with our in-house liver-derived relative expression factors (REF) and relative activity factors (RAF) revealed that, in addition to UGT1A4, UGT2B10 was involved in the N2-glucuronidation of lamotrigine. This was further confirmed via chemical inhibition in human liver microsomes with the UGT1A4-selective inhibitor hecogenin and the UGT2B10-selective inhibitor desloratadine. By integrating various orthogonal approaches (i.e., REF- and RAF-scaling, and chemical inhibition), we quantitatively determined that the f<sub>m</sub> for UGT1A4 and UGT2B10 ranged from 0.42 - 0.64 and 0.32 - 0.57, respectively. Finally, we also provided nascent evidence that the pharmacokinetic interaction between lamotrigine and valproic acid likely arose from the in vivo inhibition of its UGT2B10-mediated pathway.",

While there is consensus that UGT1A4 plays a predominant role in the formation of the N2-glucuronide, there is compelling evidence in the literature to suggest that the metabolism of lamotrigine is catalyzed by another UGT isoform. However, the exact identity of the UGT isoform that contribute to the formation of this glucuronide remains uncertain. In this study, we harnessed a robust reaction phenotyping strategy to delineate the identities and its associated fraction metabolized (f<sub>m</sub>) of the UGTs involved in lamotrigine N2-glucuronidation. Foremost, human recombinant UGT mapping experiments revealed that the N2-glucuronide is catalyzed by multiple UGT isoforms. (i.e., UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, and 2B10). Thereafter, scaling the apparent intrinsic clearances obtained from the enzyme kinetic experiments with our in-house liver-derived relative expression factors (REF) and relative activity factors (RAF) revealed that, in addition to UGT1A4, UGT2B10 was involved in the N2-glucuronidation of lamotrigine. This was further confirmed via chemical inhibition in human liver microsomes with the UGT1A4-selective inhibitor hecogenin and the UGT2B10-selective inhibitor desloratadine. By integrating various orthogonal approaches (i.e., REF- and RAF-scaling, and chemical inhibition), we quantitatively determined that the f<sub>m</sub> for UGT1A4 and UGT2B10 ranged from 0.42 - 0.64 and 0.32 - 0.57, respectively. Finally, we also provided nascent evidence that the pharmacokinetic interaction between lamotrigine and valproic acid likely arose from the in vivo inhibition of its UGT2B10-mediated pathway.",

Morphine undergoes glucuronidation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 to form morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide. Morphine is the gold standard for chronic pain management and has a narrow therapeutic index. Reports have shown that chronic pain patients have increasingly used other supplements to treat their chronic pain, including cannabidiol (CBD). Up to 50% of chronic pain patients report that they co-use cannabis with their prescribed opioid for pain management, including morphine. Previous work has shown that cannabidiol is a potent inhibitor of UGT2B7, including morphine-mediated metabolism. Co-use of morphine and CBD may result in unwanted drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Methods: Using available physiochemical and clinical parameters, morphine and CBD physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were developed and validated in both healthy and cirrhotic populations. Models for the two populations were then combined to predict the severity and clinical relevance of the potential DDIs during coadministration of both morphine and CBD in both healthy and hepatic-impaired virtual populations. Results: The predictive DDI model suggests that a ~5% increase in morphine exposure is to be expected in healthy populations. A similar increase in exposure of morphine is predicted in severe hepatic-impaired populations with an increase of ~10. Conclusions: While these predicted increases in morphine exposure are below the Food and Drug Administration's cutoff (1.25-fold increase), morphine has a narrow therapeutic index and a 5-10% increase in exposure may be clinically relevant. Future clinical studies are needed to fully characterize the clinical relevance of morphine-related DDIs.",

            "source": "The landscape of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Lebanon is unique because of high rates of consanguinity, shared ancestry, and increased remote consanguinity. ASD prevalence in Lebanon is 1 in 68 with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. This study aims to investigate the impact of an inherited deletion in UBLCP1 (Ubiquitin-Like Domain-Containing CTD Phosphatase 1) on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and proteolysis. Whole exome sequencing in a Lebanese family with ASD without pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) uncovered a deletion in UBLCP1. Functional evaluation of the identified variant is described in fibroblasts from the affected. The deletion in UBLCP1 exon 10 (g.158,710,261CAAAG > C) generates a premature stop codon interrupting the phosphatase domain and is predicted as pathogenic. It is absent from databases of normal variation worldwide and in Lebanon. Wild-type UBLCP1 is widely expressed in mouse brains. The mutation results in decreased UBLCP1 protein expression in patient-derived fibroblasts from the autistic patient compared to controls. The truncated UBLCP1 protein results in increased proteasome activity decreased ubiquitinated protein levels, and downregulation in expression of other proteasome subunits in samples from the affected compared to controls. Inhibition of the proteasome by using MG132 in proband cells reverses alterations in gene expression due to the restoration of protein levels of the common transcription factor, NRF1.

Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ARX788 (1.5 mg/kg, IV, Q3W) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (LC: lapatinib 1250 mg QD; capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID, days 1-14, Q3W) and stratified by prior chemotherapy lines (0-1 versus >1) and visceral metastasis (yes versus no). The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). A total of 441 patients were randomly assigned to receive either ARX788 (n = 221) or LC (n = 220). The median PFS was 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.8) months with ARX788 compared with 8.2 (95% CI, 6.9-8.7) months with LC, as per BICR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, p = 0.0006). Frequencies of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade were 98.6% and 99.1% for ARX788 and LC, respectively. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were 41.4% and 40.0%, respectively, the most common adverse events were blurred vision (12.3%), dry eye (9.1%), keratopathy (5.9%), and interstitial lung disease (ILD, 5.9%) with ARX788; hand-foot syndrome (18.1%) and hypokalemia (5.1%) with LC; all the hematological and gastrointestinal events of grade ≥3 with ARX788 were less than 3%.

Lysine methyltransferase 5C (KMT5C) is a trimethyltransferase of histone H4 and lysine 20 (H4K20me3) and has been reported to function vary in different types of cancer. However, the role of KMT5C in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is unknown. By analyzing the expression of KMT5C in 32 paired OSCC and normal specimens, we first found that KMT5C expression was decreased in OSCC samples. For TNM and T stages, patients from stage I and II showed high expression of KMT5C, while patients from stage III and IV tended to have low expression of KMT5C. KMT5C overexpression significantly retarded the growth and metastasis of OSCC cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas KMT5C knockdown had opposite effects. Notably, in OSCC cells, KMT5C overexpression significantly decreased uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1) expression, which was overexpressed in OSCC cells and associated with lymph node metastasis and poor overall survival of OSCC patients. We further demonstrated that overexpression of KMT5C increased the H4K20me3 modification of the UPP1 promoter, leading to transcriptional inhibition. Additionally, transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group C member 2 (NR2C2) was responsible for recruiting KMT5C to the UPP1 promoter to achieve H4K20me3 modification of UPP1.

Lysine methyltransferase 5C (KMT5C) is a trimethyltransferase of histone H4 and lysine 20 (H4K20me3) and has been reported to function vary in different types of cancer. However, the role of KMT5C in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is unknown. By analyzing the expression of KMT5C in 32 paired OSCC and normal specimens, we first found that KMT5C expression was decreased in OSCC samples. For TNM and T stages, patients from stage I and II showed high expression of KMT5C, while patients from stage III and IV tended to have low expression of KMT5C. KMT5C overexpression significantly retarded the growth and metastasis of OSCC cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas KMT5C knockdown had opposite effects. Notably, in OSCC cells, KMT5C overexpression significantly decreased uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1) expression, which was overexpressed in OSCC cells and associated with lymph node metastasis and poor overall survival of OSCC patients. We further demonstrated that overexpression of KMT5C increased the H4K20me3 modification of the UPP1 promoter, leading to transcriptional inhibition. Additionally, transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group C member 2 (NR2C2) was responsible for recruiting KMT5C to the UPP1 promoter to achieve H4K20me3 modification of UPP1. Alterations induced by KMT5C knockdown were partly reversed by UPP1 inhibition. Overall, we demonstrate that KMT5C, recruited by NR2C2, suppresses OSCC progression by inhibiting UPP1 transcription in a H4K20me3-dependent way.",

Evidence suggests that Cyc/CDK targets extend beyond traditional proteins and include enzymes that regulate the central carbon metabolism. Maize embryo axes rapidly internalize and metabolize glucose. After 24 h of imbibition in glucose-rich media, axes exhibited increased length and weight, with more pronounced effects at 72 h. This morphology enhancement was impaired when RO-3306, a specific CDK inhibitor, was added. The protein profile of maize embryo extracts at 18 and 24 h indicated altered phosphorylation patterns following CDK activity inhibition. Metabolomic analysis at 24 h of imbibition revealed that maize embryos without sugar in the media, with or without RO-3306, had a decreased sugar and amino acid content. Conversely, axes exposed to glucose demonstrated increased conversion into various mono and di-saccharides such as fructose, mannitol, galactose, and maltose but not sucrose. This pattern was reversed upon the addition of RO-3306. Glucose promoted the accumulation of amino acids such as cysteine, valine, leucine, and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, such as malate and citrate. The CDK inhibitor redirected the glucose metabolism toward increased serine levels, followed by other amino acids like phenylalanine, valine, and leucine. Additionally, TCA cycle intermediates and sterols significantly decreased. Overall, these results contribute to understanding the role of CDK in maize morphogenesis during germination and underscore its impact on modulating various central carbon pathways, including glycolysis, amino acid catabolism/anabolism, TCA cycle, and sterols biosynthesis.",

Advances in molecular biology have led to the identification of biomarkers associated with lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis, including lymphatic vessel endothelial cell (LVEC) markers and tumour microenvironment markers, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3), podoplanin (PDPN), and lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE1). LVEC molecular markers play a profound role in both the formation of new lymphatic vessels and the invasive expansion of primary tumour. Abnormal expression of LVEC markers may contribute to lymphatic vessel disease and/or metastasis of cancer cells through the lymphatic system. These molecular markers may present a potential for targeted therapies and precision diagnostics for managing lymphatic metastasis in breast cancer. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current understanding of the molecular and cellular machinery underlying lymphatic metastasis in breast cancer, with a particular focus on the lymphangiogenic markers and their role in the lymphatic dissemination.",

Exosomes from 5-FU resistant CRC cells (HCT-15/FU) significantly enhanced the resistance to 5-FU and the malignant properties of HCT-15 cells. Double screening of miRNAs in CRC cell-exosomes and serum-exosomes from clinical CRC patients revealed that miR-224-5p was expressed at significantly lower levels in the 5-FU resistant type than in the 5-FU sensitive type. Moreover, the overall survival rates of 5-FU-resistant CRC patients were much lower than those of 5-FU-sensitive CRC patients. Furthermore, cellular miRNA sequencing (miR-Seq) and proteomic studies revealed that several miRNAs such as miR-224-5p, were significantly downregulated and that calcium-related proteins, including S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4), were upregulated in HCT-15/FU cells. An analysis of data from public databases revealed that patients with CRC with lower S100A4 expression had a better prognosis. In addition, miR-224-5p was shown to directly target S100A4. Functionally, in vitro and in vivo experiments verified that the downregulation of miR-224-5p promoted malignant properties and resistance to 5-FU in HCT-15 cells, whereas the upregulation of miR-224-5p in HCT-15/FU cells attenuated these effects. Notably, 5-FU combined with verapamil reversed 5-FU resistance in CRC by regulating the miR-224-5p/S100A4 pathway.

Recent clinical studies implicate vitamin K in the pathophysiology of diabetes, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse β cells lacking γ-carboxylation fail to adapt their insulin secretion in the context of age-related insulin resistance or diet-induced β cell stress.

We identify endoplasmic reticulum Gla protein (ERGP) as a γ-carboxylated ER-resident Ca2+-binding protein expressed in β cells.

This study evaluated the in vitro antioxidant, alpha-amylase inhibitory, in vivo oral hypoglycemic, and in silico antidiabetic potential of Smallanthus sonchifolius (S. sonchifolius) leaf extract. Mice (n = 25) were divided into five groups after a 16-h fast with access to water.

Fasting blood glucose levels were measured in tail vein blood before the experiment and at 30, 60, and 120 min post-administration to evaluate the hypoglycemic activity of the extract and standard drug. The ethanolic extract exhibited dose-dependent alpha-amylase inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> value 0.136 mg/mL) and significant hypoglycemic effects, reducing blood glucose levels similar to those of the standard drugs voglibose and metformin. The maximum blood glucose reduction was 17.99% and 15.74% in the normal and glucose-loaded mice, respectively, at 500 mg/kg within 120 min.

In this context, 16 different polymeric film forming solutions (PFFS) of ZAL were developed using different grades of Eudragits, Polyvinylpyrrolidones, Kollicoat MAE 100 P and Hydroxypropyl cellulose as film formers, and polyethylene glycol 400 as a plasticizer in equal parts of ethanol and isopropyl alcohol used as solvents. Of these solutions, F13 composed of Kollicoat MAE 100 P emerged as an optimal PFFS as it quickly formed a saturated film (10.25 ± 0.75 min) that displayed low drying time (3.00 ± 0.46 min), and high in vitro adhesion (2.67 ± 0.58).

Using the concept of organometallic derivatization pioneered by Jaouen and Brocard, we synthesized five new organometallic Zileuton derivatives, maintaining the urea fragment and incorporating ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl moiety (3a-e). Their biological activity was evaluated against 5-LOX, 15-LOX, COX-1, and COX-2 enzymes. The ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl N-hydroxyurea complexes coined Ferroleuton (3a) and Ruthenoleuton (3e) showed the highest selective inhibitory activity against 5-LOX, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.21 ± 0.12 and 3.49 ± 1.11 μM, respectively. Notably, 3a exhibited superior activity compared to Zileuton (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.67 ± 0.09 μM), demonstrating the key role of N-hydroxyurea and ferrocenyl fragments in the inhibitory process. Worthy of note, both compounds displayed low cytotoxicity in lung fibroblast healthy cells line (MRC-5) (CC<sub>50</sub> of 116.40 and >200 μM, respectively). Enzyme kinetic studies indicated competitive and mixed types of inhibition for 3a and 3e, respectively. Additionally, they demonstrated superior antioxidant capacity compared to Zileuton (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays). Electrochemical and molecular dynamics (MD) studies suggest a chelating-redox deactivation mechanism for 5-LOX. These findings position Ferroleuton (3a) and Ruthenoleuton (3e) as promising candidates for inflammatory disease treatment.",
